<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">It&#8217;s</span> of no use, and what&#8217;s more, I
don&#8217;t believe it&#8217;s right,&#8221; said Mr. Jeffries,
&#8220;this filling every boy&#8217;s head with
thoughts of rising in the world. It looks
all very well in books; but is quite a
different thing in reality. I tell you
what, it&#8217;s doing a mighty deal of damage
in the world. Why, it&#8217;s almost impossible
for anybody that wants help to get
any of the right sort. Once find a boy
that has any grit in him, and he&#8217;s off as
soon as he can scrape up enough money
to go to school with. There&#8217;s that stable-boy
of mine, as good a little fellow as I&#8217;d
ever care to have; but in the room of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
playing like other boys, when he has a
moment&#8217;s leisure, he&#8217;s off to the barn
with a book in his hand. I&#8217;ve told him
many a time &#8217;twould be the ruin of him;
but he seems to take to it as naturally as a
duck does to water;&#8221; and the little hotel-keeper
looked around complacently.</p>

<p>&#8220;I thought that was the very spirit
that was commendable in this country,
Mr. Jeffries,&#8221; said I, turning my gaze
from the mountain towering above us to
the face of my host. &#8220;Hope is the
grand incentive to the American boy,
the hope of knowing more, and doing
better for himself and others, than his
father and grandfather did before him.
Look around you and see who are the
men of the present; ten to one they are
poor men&#8217;s sons. They felt that they
could do something, and they accomplished
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks all fair, I allow; but the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">[5]</span>
thing is carried too far; it makes them
discontented and unsteady, changing from
one thing to another. In my opinion, if
you want to make any thing in the world,
you must stick to one thing. It is an old
saying, &#8216;A rolling stone gathers no moss.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; but may not these poor boys
have a higher aim and purpose, and carry
it out quite as effectually as if it
required no changes? Your stable-boy
may have mapped out, vaguely perhaps,
his future, and to reach it must make use
of such stepping-stones as come within
his reach. He does his work well, does
he not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, there&#8217;s nothing to say against
him, only I don&#8217;t like to see him always
reading; he can&#8217;t go by a newspaper&mdash;and
my wife keeps them hung up by the
side of the roller&mdash;without stopping for
a bit, catching as a hungry horse does at
a spear of grass or hay that comes within<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
his reach. I give him pretty good
wages for a boy, and the women folks
patch up his clothes and see that he has
plenty to eat. It seems to me that he
ought to be contented and happy, with
jests and frolic like the rest, in the room
of being shut up with his book. And
then, to cap all, I went into the barn the
other day, and there he was perched up
on the haymow, talking away and making
gestures just as the parson does. I
could not keep from laughing, and he came
down and skulked away looking sheepish
enough.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You have interested me in this boy,
Mr. Jeffries. Who, and what is he?
Where did you find him?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, his father lives up among the
mountains, a thriftless, good for nothing
creature, who spends all his earnings in
whiskey. The mother was a delicate
ladylike woman; my wife thought a heap<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">[7]</span>
of her; and when she died, she made us
both promise to look after her children.&#8221;</p>

<p>Just then a showy carriage was driven
round from the stable, and a sprightly lad
jumped quickly down, and stood holding
the lines respectfully while the owner
made ready to start. He was a tall,
slight young man, whom I had noticed in
the hotel as excessively talkative, flush
with his money, drinking and smoking
freely, and interlarding his conversation
with now and then an oath. He came
out with a swagger, followed by a little
crowd of idlers. Mr. Jeffries broke off
the thread of conversation, giving the
hand of his guest a prolonged shake.</p>

<p>&#8220;Always glad to see you when you
come this way, Robinson; you will always
find the bar just the same; I never
keep any thing but the best.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a fact; the best mint julep
I&#8217;ve had in a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span>While the leave-taking was going on,
I was eagerly scanning the face of the
stable-boy. My heart ached for him as
he stood there, the little torn straw hat
just covering the mass of dark hair, that
had apparently not seen a comb for days,
the great heavy locks clustering over a
broad well-formed forehead, above delicately
curved eyebrows with long brown
lashes. But the eyes were hidden; I
could only imagine what they must be
from the profile of the face, the straight
nose, somewhat deep upper lip, and well-turned
chin. Still and straight he stood,
and almost as motionless as though carved
out of marble: yet not a dead, passive
statue; his very stillness had a life in it,
just as the framework of machinery is
still while the movable parts are running
swift as thought can follow.</p>

<p>Down the steps and into the buggy
the young gentleman passed, and as the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">[9]</span>
lines were handed him he tossed a silver
coin to the stable-boy, but so carelessly
that it glanced from his shoulder, rolled
across the porch and down a crack in the
floor before he could stop it.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s gone, Marston; better luck next
time,&#8221; said Mr. Jeffries with a patronizing
air. The boy bit his lips, while the
eyelids quivered, and turning on his heel
was out of sight in an instant.</p>

<p>It was not in my heart to talk any
more. Life was new to me; I was myself
trying to make my way upward in character
and life. Just through college, my
health failed, and I was told to try mountain
air and exercise. My meagre purse
would not allow of my gratifying my
benevolent feelings, and still every day
there were just such cases occurring.
&#8220;Work yourself out&#8221; had been my
motto. No doubt Marston Howe would
adopt the same. A rough, thorny way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">[10]</span>
he will find; the feet will become weary,
the hands torn and bleeding; still, if he
wills he will succeed. It is better to
wear out than to rust out; better be a
climber than a cumberer; and though
we seem never fully to attain our desires,
let not the heart grow bitter and
misanthropic, moody and uncharitable.
Success is sure if we try for it. Let me
whisper this to Marston Howe, and I
have then done him all the good I can.
Looking up I saw the doctor&#8217;s buggy
coming slowly round the curve of the
mountain, and a moment after it drew
up, while a kindly face looked out. &#8220;How
is this invalid of mine? Almost ready
to go home?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Nearly ready, doctor,&#8221; and my eye
caught sight of the stable-boy with his
pail of water for the doctor&#8217;s horse.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Marston,&#8221; said Mr. Jeffries;
&#8220;the doctor&#8217;s horse don&#8217;t like to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">[11]</span>
pass here without something,&#8221; but the
doctor did not notice the hint.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are fond of books,&#8221; I said to
Marston as he held the pail for the horse
to drink; &#8220;I have one in my pocket which
I think will please you. It is called
&#8216;Self Helps,&#8217; and will show you how
others have worked and struggled to become
good and useful men. I hope that
is what you wish to do.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall try for it,&#8221; he answered in a
clear tone, while his grey eye brightened
as he grasped the book. &#8220;Aim to do
right, Marston, and what you do, do well;
perhaps we shall meet again.&#8221;</p>

<p>Quick as an arrow he bounded round
the corner, and the doctor&#8217;s pony trotted
leisurely down the mountain with
us.</p>

<p>It had been a glorious afternoon, and
I had taken a longer stroll than usual;
resting at the little mountain house, while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span>
the doctor visited a patient further up the
mountain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know any thing of Marston&#8217;s
family, doctor?&#8221; asked I, when we finished
what we had to say of the immediate
landscape.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not much. The mother was a well-educated
gentlewoman, above the majority
in these parts; she died soon after I
came here, and her husband soon married
a real vixen. They say he spent
every thing in whiskey after that, and
these two children, Marston and Jennie,
live with Mr. Jeffries, a good-natured
man in his way, but mightily puffed up
with his success in that hotel. He has
a good many boarders in summer, and is
making a great deal of money.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time pony had struck into a
quicker pace; the road was more familiar,
or he scented the corn crib, and his master
let him have the rein.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span>The next day I left the mountains, but
not without a thought of Marston Howe,
and an earnest wish that he might succeed.</p>

<p>Poor, and dependent on his own labor,
there was something in his case that reminded
me strangely of my own; and
more than once I felt my heart throb
with a quicker beat as I thought of what
might be in store for him, had he the
courage ever to undertake what I saw
from his look he so earnestly craved.</p>

<p>Still, with constant effort, untiring self-denial,
and inflexible purpose, the height
might be won. The germs of the future
harvest must be planted before it can be
gathered in. Slow and difficult might be
the ascent, and many a time the feet
might falter in the way, and the heart
well-nigh break, while weakness, prejudice,
and passion hinder the progress of
the eager soul.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">[14]</span>One look to God, however, and obstacles
vanish, doubts dissolve. His strength
is never denied those that ask him. Marston
Howe&#8217;s mother was a Christian.
His cradle was consecrated by her prayers,
and the little son she left behind her
was still the object of divine love and
care. Such thoughts comforted me. He
must go up through the narrow defile of
labor, the rocky strait of necessity; but
he will overcome: the mother&#8217;s prayers
will not be lost.</p>

<p>Years have passed since that summer
day: we have both been climbers; both
began at the same level, the only difference
being that I had the start by some
half a score of years; difference enough
when starting in the race, but hardly perceptible
when standing, as we both now
do, nearer the top than the bottom of the
ladder.</p>

<p>Last summer I again met with Marston<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">[15]</span>
Howe; and for the sake of the climbers
who have suffered and striven, and of
others who are still suffering and striving,
I am induced to tell his story as
nearly as he told me as I can well remember
it.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">II.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Of</span> my early life I cannot remember
much before we went to the mountains,
and still I have always had a vague remembrance
of a pleasant home surrounded
with tall trees, a fountain bubbling
up and catching the sun&#8217;s rays in a thousand
bewildering forms, sweet flowers,
and singing birds; while in my own little
room there was a curious round glass
with rock and moss at the bottom, where
the gold fish flashed their beauty through
the crystal water. Then there were days
indistinct and shadowy, when the glory
and beauty had gone, where I hardly
knew, and we had another home&mdash;my
mother, Jennie, and I.</p>

<p>My father I had seldom seen, and now
I saw less of him than before. I did not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">[17]</span>
so much wonder, for it was not home to
me, that little brown house perched like
a bird&#8217;s nest on the shelf of the mountain.
I did not like it, and often used to ask
my mother why we were there. She
never used to answer me; but putting
her arm around me drew me closely to
her, kissing me over and over again,
while the tears fell on my face, but saying
nothing.</p>

<p>It was not so with Jennie, the pretty
golden-haired baby that I used to rock
in a nice little crib in our first home.
Then we had pretty carpeted floors, and
I could ride my pony all day in a room
made on purpose to play in.</p>

<p>But when I grew older I saw it all,
and understood why my mother pressed
me to her heart and wept. I then knew
what made my father reel and stagger
so as he came up the path; and why,
when Jennie put up her hands, and crowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">[18]</span>
out her evening welcome, he took no
notice of her, and one night came very
near crushing the little creature as he fell
over the threshold. Oh, sad, sad days,
when he was so cross, declaring the house
was cold and cheerless, or the rooms
were so bare of comfort&mdash;when he went
to the village at the foot of the hills every
morning, and if he did not come back at
night, mother took Jennie in her arms,
and we went after him.</p>

<p>In this way we lived till Jennie was
five years old; then mother grew sick,
and for days lay on the bed so white and
still, Jennie curling up beside her, putting
her little chubby cheek close to the
thin pallid one, while I dug up raspberry
roots and boiled them into broth for
mother and the baby to eat.</p>

<p>One day she spoke less frequently; I
thought she was asleep, and walked about
very carefully so as not to wake her: at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">[19]</span>
length she looked up, beckoned me to
her, put her arms about my neck, and
kissed me. &#8220;Whatever happens,&#8221; she
said, &#8220;you must be a good boy, Marston.
You are now almost ten years old; you
will take good care of Jennie, and never
let her leave you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, mother; but what makes you
talk so?&#8221; and I cried aloud in grief and
fear.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am very sick, Marston, and I may
die. If I do, you will take care of Jennie;
promise me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, mother; but you will not die.
God must not&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Hush, my son; God knows what is
best; you will always remember to love
and obey Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How can I, mother, if he takes you?
You are all we have in the world. What
will Jennie and I do without you? No,
mother, if he is good, he will not do this;&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">[20]</span>
and I buried my face in the pillows. My
poor sick mother put her thin arms about
my neck, and drew me still nearer, her
hot cheek meeting mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;God <i>is</i> good, my child, and still I
must leave you. Mother would not tell
you any thing that was not so. You believe
me, Marston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you, mother,&#8221; I cried passionately,
&#8220;but I cannot let you go; if
you go, I must go with you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Marston, you must stay to take
care of Jennie and your father. Jennie
is such a little girl, what would become
of her without you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will it make you happier, mother, if
I take care of Jennie?&#8221; and I kissed her
white cheeks again and again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, my son, I shall be very happy
if you will promise to be a good boy, and
take care of your little sister for Christ
and for me.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">[21]</span>&#8220;I will promise; I will be good, mother,&#8221;
and my tears were dried.</p>

<p>Invested with a new dignity as the
protector of my little sister, I must be a
man; and I took up Jennie and fed her
from the one little china bowl that remained
to us of our old home.</p>

<p>Weary with the effort of talking, my
mother fell asleep, looking so calm and
placid; while I rocked the baby, and
watched her quiet breathing.</p>

<p>Presently a neighbor came in, and
bending over the bed asked how long
she had been sick.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two weeks,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor thing; why didn&#8217;t she send for
the doctor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She thought she should be better
soon,&#8221; I replied, laying Jennie down on
the foot of the bed; and going softly to
my mother, I gently kissed the pale forehead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span>&#8220;Marston, promise,&#8221; and she opened
her eyes.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do, I will, mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Dear me, Mrs. Howe, why did you
not send for me? your husband told me
this morning that you were sick; and as
soon as we had dinner, I came right up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew there was no help for me.
If it was not for leaving my children&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be troubled, Mrs. Howe. It
isn&#8217;t much that I have, but such as it is
they shall have a part.&#8221;</p>

<p>Slowly the sun went down, and as the
darkness rolled up the mountain father
came home. He was steadier than usual,
and for the first time he seemed sorry
that mother was sick; took her hand
kindly in his, and bent over the pillow
and kissed her.</p>

<p>&#8220;Only get well, Mary, and I will stay
at home always.&#8221; It was all he could
say, the tears choked him.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span>&#8220;I am very sick, Robert. You will
do this for the children,&#8221; and her eyes
closed.</p>

<p>All night the two watched by her bed,
Mrs. Jeffries and father; while Jennie
nestled in my arms, occasionally putting
up her mouth for a kiss, thinking it was
mother.</p>

<p>I lived an age in that night, and how
many resolves I formed and plans laid
of what I would do, and how I would
care for that one little sister.</p>

<p>Alas, I had to learn that he who wins
must walk through rough places; that
the sweet rest for which we long is only
given to those who have been prompt in
duty, resolute against temptation, strong
in faith, patient in the hour of trial.
Alas for the weary feet that must walk
through the world without a mother&#8217;s
guidance.</p>

<p>Before morning Jennie and I were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">[24]</span>
alone, while my poor father was stricken
into soberness.</p>

<p>Three months passed. My father was
much steadier, stayed more at home, and
was no longer cross and overbearing;
for hours would he read to us, then
taking Jennie on his knee, sing her to
sleep.</p>

<p>&#8220;If mother could only see him,&#8221; I said
frequently to myself. I had not known
he was so handsome, for he kept himself
much better, and looked like a new man.
Then at night he would put us in bed,
and sometimes sit down by himself, or go
out looking so good and happy; I did not
understand it.</p>

<p>One day I had been down to Mrs. Jeffries
with Jennie, and Mr. Jeffries asked
me what I would think if my father gave
me a new mother. I told him that could
not be; we could not have but one mother,
and our mother was dead.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">[25]</span>&#8220;But what if your father marries
again?&#8221;</p>

<p>I went home in tears. Cheerless as
our home was, I could not bear that another
should enter it. It was no place
for a good woman to come, and I felt it
so. It was not long, however, before I
found the reality of what I feared. My
father, on the strength of his good looks,
married a pretty, showily dressed woman,
and brought her to our mountain home.
Very kindly he introduced us; but she
did not so much as kiss either of us. I
grew indignant, and could have darted
out of the house, but for my remembered
promise to my mother.</p>

<p>A year, and she had turned us out,
while a baby of her own nestled in her
arms, and our father was nearly as bad
as ever. Jennie had always been a
delicate little thing, or my new mother
would not so readily have parted with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">[26]</span>
her. But my father, with all his waywardness,
always said to her that we
should not be parted.</p>

<p>We knew no one but Mrs. Jeffries,
and she kindly consented to take us in;
while her husband allowed me to hold
the horses, and after a time to drive
them to and from the stable.</p>

<p>In this way I gained something. The
first winter I was there I went to school
eighteen days; not enough to learn much,
and still enough to give me a thirst for
more. The schoolmaster was a lame
man that lived near the school-house,
and directly on my way.</p>

<p>Thin and scant my clothes were, and
I used sometimes to go in and warm myself.
What a different atmosphere pervaded
his home: his mother, a sweet
woman, with soft braids of still brown
hair about her face, while her mild blue
eyes reminded me of my own mother,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">[27]</span>
and not unfrequently the tears would
start as she inquired kindly for my little
sister.</p>

<p>Charles Brisbane was to be a clergyman;
and when he read and prayed with
us every morning, it seemed the easiest
thing in the world to be good, and I wondered
why my father had not been just
such another good man. And when at
the close of the day he talked to us of
the dear Saviour, who came down to
earth, took upon himself our nature, suffered
and died to redeem us, I resolved
that I would love and trust and serve
him; and then I thought he would take
care of Jennie and me, and make my
father a sober man. Then I used to
shut my eyes, and dream all sorts of
pleasant things, longing for a world
where the people loved each other and
did right, and where death would never
come.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">[28]</span>My dear mother seemed to be very
near me whenever Charles Brisbane was
talking; and when I went back to Mr.
Jeffries&#8217; it did not seem so hard to do
the little errands that were always ready
for me.</p>

<p>Jennie was beginning to do something
for Mrs. Jeffries, who herself took the
lead in her own house-work; and of course
could not be expected to do more for us
than to see that we had plenty to eat,
were tidy, and not actually ragged.</p>

<p>I remember stopping one day at Mr.
Brisbane&#8217;s, and how I longed to be able
to go to school regularly; and could not
but say this in rather a fretful mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry that you cannot come,
Marston; but remember that you can
learn, wherever you are.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How so?&#8221; said I.</p>

<p>&#8220;By reading and studying at home.
Improve all your time; always have a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">[29]</span>
book in your pocket or on a shelf near
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have no books.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I am going to give you some. Here
is the Geography you studied at school,
and your Arithmetic. True, you are just
commencing, but with occasional help, I
have no doubt you will get on finely.
Come to school when you can; but when
kept at home by Mr. Jeffries, do not fret
over it. Do your work faithfully, and look
forward. God helps those who help themselves.
He will not leave you, my boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>How strong and happy I felt as I
climbed up the hill-side to Mr. Jeffries&#8217;
house. I forgot the dark, cold mornings
when I had to rise at four o&#8217;clock,
and make paths through the snow; and
help feed the stock and see to the horses,
the poor patient brutes waiting until an
opening could be made in the trough, or
the snow melted. Then there were pigs<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">[30]</span>
to feed, and corn to shell for the poultry,
and the kitchen to sweep; and by the
time I had done it was nearly noon, and
too late for school that day. And Jennie
would climb up into my lap, and tell me
not to cry; and I would read my Geography
to her very much as, the last summer,
I had read Jack the Giant Killer,
Babes in the Wood, Robinson Crusoe,
and Sinbad the Sailor; her blue eyes
looking up wonderingly as she nestled
still closer, laying her white velvet cheek
to my brown one.</p>

<p>Dear little comforter, much as I loved
her, my heart rebelled not a little at the
loss of school-hours. Still I did not forget
Mr. Brisbane&#8217;s words, so that I neither
cried nor murmured outwardly,
studying every moment I could get, and
repeating my lesson aloud to Jennie, who
in her turn began to study geography,
and to make figures on my slate.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">[31]</span>My writing lesson I suffered the most
in. But Mrs. Jeffries had a sister that
visited her occasionally, and when there,
Miss Grimshaw condescended to set me
copies; so that between my duties at
home, Mr. Brisbane, and Miss Grimshaw,
I made considerable advancement.</p>

<p>Mr. Jeffries scolded not a little whenever
he saw my books, and one day actually
tossed them out of the window,
where Molly the cook rescued them from
a mischievous puppy, minus one of the
covers. I could have cried over this;
but the leaves were all there, and afterwards
Mrs. Jeffries gave us two chairs
and a little table in her linen closet;
and as this was the tidiest place in the
house, and above all, never entered save
by Mrs. Jeffries, we were for a time uncommonly
happy.</p>

<p>While I had my books and a chair in
the linen closet, Jennie had a few pots of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">[32]</span>
geraniums and tea-roses that Mrs. Brisbane
had sent her, and which she nurtured
with great care. Never shall I
forget the look of distress on the little
face, when one morning she had watered
them tenderly, taxing her strength not a
little to set them where they would have
all the benefit of the sun, watching them
with delight, counting the buds on the
rose-bush, and thinking of the little bouquets
she would be sure to make, first
for me and then for Mrs. Jeffries, putting
one in Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s room by way of
surprise. All at once Mr. Jeffries came
through the room, and seeing the little
girl idle for the moment, with one sweep
of his hand landed the rose-bush in the
middle of the yard, the stem broken and
the opening buds torn. There was not
a tear, not a word of complaint as she
stole up to the linen closet and laid the
ruined stem in my hands, hiding her face<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">[33]</span>
on my shoulder, and trembling like an
aspen.</p>

<p>&#8220;Who has done this, Jennie?&#8221; said I
hurriedly, and in a passion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be vexed at him; it was Mr.
Jeffries. He&#8217;ll be sorry to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But this was yours; what right had
he to touch it? I will go and ask him;&#8221;
and I flung down my book and started up.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, Marston, you must not anger
him. It is all the home we have; and if
you vex him, he may turn us away, or
at least not let you have this nice little
closet to study in.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was something in Jennie&#8217;s philosophy
that quieted me a little; and
drawing her to my side, I tried first to
command myself and then comfort her.
Excited as the poor child was, she soon
fell asleep; and not seeing any thing but
the clean white linen in the room, I took
off my coat and spread it on the floor, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">[34]</span>
laid her down. Accustomed to a hard
bed, she did not waken. Try as I would,
I could not study, but sat looking at the
broken rose-bush and then at the thin,
troubled face of the sleeper, the blue lids
swollen, and the delicate veins plainly
perceptible about the throbbing temples.</p>

<p>&#8220;How could he do it? By what right
deny this little child the only treasure
she possessed?&#8221; and I was getting into a
passion again, when Mrs. Jeffries entered.</p>

<p>She read it all at a glance; went out
and brought a quilt and a pillow for
Jennie, and taking up the broken stalk,
looked at the roots.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will live. There is another pot,
Marston, and if you will fill it with fresh
mould, I will help you. Its beauty has
gone for the present, but it will grow
again.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not move or stir, my anger was
too deep. She laid her hand on my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">[35]</span>
shoulder, and kindly said, &#8220;You can&#8217;t
be sorrier than I am, Marston. I saw it
all: but you wont be angry; Mr. Jeffries
will be sorry to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Just what Jennie said; but that
wont help it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It may, Marston; at least it will not
do any good to be angry about it. I
know you wont, Marston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I will not be angry;&#8221; and at
once I went to work filling the pot.
Mrs. Jeffries cut off the broken part,
put the buds the least injured in a little
china vase filled with salt and water,
and set them on a shelf in the little attic
where Jennie slept. I did not see Jennie
again till my work was done at night,
when she said cheerily,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Jeffries says it will grow again.
It was very good of her, wasn&#8217;t it, Marston?&#8221;
and she nestled by my side, and
together we studied our geography.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">[36]</span>When the warm weather came, the
schoolmaster and his mother went away,
and we never saw them afterwards.
When the June sun was glowing, and
the soft winds wafted the fragrant breath
of flowers up through the mountain gorges,
Mr. Jeffries&#8217; house was once more
filled with visitors; and I was not unfrequently
called upon to show some gentleman
or lady the best views, as they
were called, until I became familiar with
the beauties and glories of nature, and
felt their genial influence thrilling me
with a new and indefinite pleasure.</p>

<p>Sometimes I was brought face to face
with the storm in the mountain passes,
while thunder and lightning shook and
vibrated through them, rolling slowly
down the sides of the mountain and
echoing along the valley in terrific grandeur.</p>

<p>One day in the heat of summer a gentleman<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">[37]</span>
came up, saying to Mr. Jeffries
that it was his intention to remain for a
week; that he had come out of the city
expressly for mountain air and scenery,
and that he wished to make the best use
of his time. His name was Kirby, and
he had not been there a day before I felt
that he was another Charles Brisbane&mdash;the
same views, the same hopes, the
same manner characterized them; and
after my work was done in the morning,
it was my privilege to join him in his
rambles, provided I returned in time to
have every thing in readiness for the
night. What made this arrangement
still pleasanter, Jennie was permitted to
go with us whenever it was not too far,
while Mr. Kirby would tell us stories of
mountains over the sea.</p>

<p>I remember, one evening, we were
flinging our lines in a little brook that
ran gurgling along through the green<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">[38]</span>
grass like a silver serpent, when Mr.
Kirby told us of the Rosenlani glacier
in such glowing language, that we seemed
to see distinctly the pale sunshine dancing
on its sharp peaks of frosted silver,
its blue ice caverns, its fringe of firs,
with hanging ledges of short crisp grass,
and giant masses of grey rock, and the
sudden shower of snow from falling avalanches.
Then he unrolled a map, and
pointed out the jagged pyramid of the
Wetterhorn, and told us of the people
that lived there; and by the time we
returned, in season to have our trout for
supper, we had learned more of the
geography of Switzerland than we should
have learned from poring over books for
a long time.</p>

<p>&#8220;To-morrow,&#8221; said Mr. Kirby, &#8220;we
must go up to the highest point of the
mountain. I am afraid my little Jennie
must stay at home.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">[39]</span>&#8220;Why so, Mr. Kirby?&#8221; and Jennie
pressed to his side; &#8220;I like to be with
you and Marston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should like to have you go, but I
am afraid it would make you sick; it
will be a hard walk for us. If I give
you a nice story to read, it will interest
you quite as much; and when we come
back, you shall tell us all about it. Besides,
Miss Grimshaw is to teach you
how to hem that new handkerchief. You
will be contented to stay now, wont
you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think it best,&#8221; and the long
brown lashes drooped over the blue eyes.</p>

<p>The next morning I was up earlier
than usual; but not before Jennie, who
insisted on sharing my labor, feeding the
pigs, and then scattering corn to the
poultry, and throwing wheat to the few
pigeons that circled about the premises.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do want to go with you,&#8221; she said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
as she kissed me good-by; but Mr. Kirby
was there with the neatly bound book
he had promised, and the tears were
soon dried, Jennie looking the last look
as she ran up to her attic to lay aside her
treasure, till the moment when her work
should be done and Mrs. Jeffries should
give her permission to do what she
pleased.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall you have patience to climb?&#8221;
asked Mr. Kirby as we stood at the base
of the tallest peak, its jagged sides covered
with stunted shrubs and shelving
rocks as far as the eye could reach, a
veil of clouds and mist resting on the
summit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall like it exceedingly. You forget
that I am accustomed to climbing.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What was it that Miss Grimshaw
called you and Jennie the other day?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The Climbers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, and the name rather pleased<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span>
me,&#8221; continued Mr. Kirby. &#8220;Heights
are to be won every day, and our stand-point
to-day should be in advance of
what it was yesterday. We are, or
should be, all climbers, using every incident,
occasion, and advantage as a stepping-stone
to something better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I fear some of us are doing it at a
snail&#8217;s pace; a lifetime of such climbing
as mine would not amount to much.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You remember the hare and the tortoise,&#8221;
said Mr. Kirby, &#8220;and which won
the race. The hare started off as some
people would to go up this mountain;
but he soon grew weary, and lay down
to rest. The tortoise began as he could
hold out, and the end justified his wisdom.&#8221;
I now understood why Mr. Kirby
was walking leisurely.</p>

<p>&#8220;When I was a lad,&#8221; continued he,
&#8220;I often visited my grandfather, who
lived on a farm in the country. On one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span>
occasion he hired two men to work in
the harvest-field. One man looked at
the small field of wheat contemptuously,
and declared it his opinion the job had
better be given to one; he could do it
all himself before sundown. Still my
grandfather insisted on the two, and
accordingly they began. One worked
furiously, and at noon he was far in advance
of his companion. As the hot
hours passed his arm grew nerveless, his
back felt as though it was broken, his
limbs ached, and his head felt like bursting.
Long before sundown he had to
withdraw to the house of the farmer;
while his companion, who had husbanded
his strength, was left to finish the field
alone. Patience when we commence is
quite as needful in intellectual as in physical
effort. The end of the race tells
who wins.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a good deal of consolation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
in that,&#8221; I ventured to remark. &#8220;Climbing
hills I can easily do; but I am sometimes
afraid that is the only climbing
that will be allowed me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not if you wish another. Obstacles
vanish before a strong and resolute will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But circumstances, Mr. Kirby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Look behind you, Marston, and you
will see that while walking and talking
at our leisure, we have been advancing
all the time, and have in reality made a
very perceptible ascent. The valley
looks like a green thread, and the few
buildings that we see like pigeon-houses.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed; we get along better
than I expected. We&#8217;ve been steadily
at it, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is it, Marston, steadily at it.
Perseverance is sure, sooner or later, to
overcome.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we have a plan, and steadily
follow it, shall we succeed?&#8221; I asked.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">[44]</span>&#8220;Almost sure to do so; not by one
endeavor, not by two, but by years of
perpetual toil and labor. Climbers have
more to contend with than those who sit
still in the valley. Do you begin to
weary, Marston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no; but the path is much rougher,
and I slip backward instead of getting
forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now you see why I took this staff
tipped with a sharp iron. It will help
us when the way is slippery. Give me
your hand; it is hard work, but nothing
good is achieved without labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>At length we reached a cliff which,
projecting boldly into our path, rose like
a dark grey wall to bar our advance.</p>

<p>&#8220;What shall we do now?&#8221; I asked;
&#8220;go back?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Never do that, unless you are out of
the way,&#8221; said Mr. Kirby. &#8220;We must
get up just as we have come so far, by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">[45]</span>
climbing. But it is so steep on this side,
we shall have to go round.&#8221; After a
short pause to ascertain the most favorable
point, Mr. Kirby with his iron-tipped
staff proceeded to put his advice
into practice. Each step was carefully
taken, another, and another; while, as
we advanced, helps arose on all sides:
here was a twig, there a rock, and there
a secure place for the feet; and without
any great fatigue, and almost before we
were aware, we stood on the top of the
enormous mass that but a short time before
had loomed up threateningly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You see where we are,&#8221; said Mr.
Kirby. &#8220;Remember, and never give up
when you undertake any thing. Stop
only sufficiently long to make sure of the
way, and then advance, one step at a
time. You see here how clearly one
step prepares the way for another; so
it will ever be. Oaks are strengthened<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">[46]</span>
by wind and storm; so men grow firm
by combating with difficulty and opposition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t see how that can make them
strong,&#8221; I said; for I did not clearly understand
the import of his words.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not mean strong in body merely,
although this might follow, but strong
in spirit, more resolute to do, more determined
to endure. If boys possess this
quality, they will be pretty sure to make
strong, reliable men, able to take a position
in the world and have an influence
among men. But look; what a splendid
view we have from this point;&#8221; and Mr.
Kirby looked over the broad panorama
with an eye that seemed to see the Deity
in his works; and from the top of that
table rock he told me of his own life, of
the obstacles in his way, the poverty and
destitution that he had known: &#8220;And
still by climbing, just as we have been<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">[47]</span>
doing to-day, I have made some progress;
and if I keep on&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you make?&#8221; I asked in
my eagerness.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would you say if you knew I
had no higher ambition than to be a
clergyman?&#8221; looking at me with a half
smile in his clear dark eye.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think I should be a lawyer, if I
was in your place, Mr. Kirby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A lawyer; why so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, there&#8217;s a better chance to rise
in the world. It must be very nice to
sway men as easily as lawyers do; and
then there&#8217;s a chance of one day being
senator or judge.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It must be very pleasant, you say,
to sway men as lawyers do. Do you
not think it equally good to sway men as
clergymen do? It is the lawyer&#8217;s business
to help men out of temporary difficulties.
It is the clergyman&#8217;s business<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">[48]</span>
to show men a better way: first to show
them their condition as sinners, then to
tell them of the precious Saviour who
died to redeem them, and who will not
only save them from temporary difficulties,
but raise them to an eternity of
happiness. Is there any thing more glorious
than this, Marston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hardly know, sir. It has always
seemed to me I should like to be a lawyer.
Yet it must be pleasant, as you
say, to make people better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will always think so,
Marston,&#8221; and Mr. Kirby gathered some
wild flowers. &#8220;They will remind us of
the walk. Flowers have the happy power
of always calling our best thoughts to the
surface.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It would seem your best thoughts
are always there, Mr. Kirby.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, my best thoughts
are sometimes out of sight entirely. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span>
have to be very watchful over myself.
I am too readily given to despondency,
and not willing to trust and be bright
and cheerful when it looks dark and lowering.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is it our duty always to be bright
and glad?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;I think so, Marston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But if every thing goes wrong with
us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Every thing cannot go wrong with
us, if we love and trust the Saviour, for
he has said that all things shall work together
for our good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what mother used to say. I
always wondered how she could.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Because she trusted him, and this
trust made her cheerful and happy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we go to the top,&#8221; I ventured to
say, &#8220;we must be going;&#8221; and again the
dry moss rustled beneath our feet. We
had not gone far before dark clouds began<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">[50]</span>
to scud over the sky, portending a
sudden storm.</p>

<p>&#8220;Had we not better return?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are much nearer the top than
the bottom of the mountain,&#8221; said Mr.
Kirby. &#8220;If a storm should come, it
would reach us before we could get half
way down. You are not afraid of a
storm, Marston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of mere rain; but this is no place
as to the wind, to say nothing of thunder
and lightning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All these are in His keeping. We
are the objects of his love.&#8221; He had
hardly finished speaking, when a fearful
gale swept down the mountain, and nearly
bore us away with it. The rain quickly
followed, while the thunder was startling,
with its quick, sharp reports, then
rolling along in one continued roar till
lost in the distance.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus054.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">[51]</span>&#8220;This will not last long,&#8221; said Mr.
Kirby, and took shelter under a great
rock, drawing me after him. How long
we stood there I hardly know, for the
dense mass of black clouds floating so
near us, carried swiftly by the winds,
rolling and unrolling their rugged edges,
fringed with the lurid glare, was the
most fascinating spectacle that I had ever
witnessed.</p>

<p>After explaining to me the different
strata of the atmosphere and some of the
causes of this sudden change in the clouds,
Mr. Kirby spoke of that great day of
storm and dread, when there would be
some to cry for the mountains to cover
them from the wrath of the Lamb, and
others to whom He would be as the shelter
of a great rock.</p>

<p>Then we stepped out from under the
rock. The shower was over, and we
again advanced. For a time the ascent
was more precipitous than any that we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">[52]</span>
had met before, while the wet boughs,
brushing against our faces, would have
seriously disturbed a less persevering
spirit than Mr. Kirby&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Among the remembrances of that day
were the tiny pools and cascades, filled
to overflowing during the shower. Then
there were spots of soft green beds of
beautiful moss, and short, steep acclivities,
such as would hardly afford footing
for the chamois or gazelle.</p>

<p>At length we stood at the top. Here,
on the very summit of the mountain,
was a lovely little lake, its water clear
as crystal, where the clouds could see
their beauty reflected without comment
or obstruction.</p>

<p>How proud and happy I felt. The
work was done. I had often looked up,
but never before attempted going to the
top. Once decided upon, it was done.
Would it be as easy with every thing else?</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">[53]</span>Scarcely had we turned from the lake,
when the sun came out, rolling up the
floating mists into wool-like drapery of
clouds, revealing a panorama of surpassing
grandeur.</p>

<p>Beneath us lay a succession of hills,
shelving down to the valley, while further
in the distance were green fields,
with farm-houses looking hardly bigger
than mole-hills, with the river winding
on to the ocean like a long blue thread;
and the ocean itself, whose boundary I
could not define, was an object of strange
wonder to me. Ignorant as I was, I
could not understand the strong emotion
that thrilled me, depriving me entirely
of the power of speech.</p>

<p>&#8220;How beautiful He hath made them
all;&#8221; and Mr. Kirby lifted his hat, and
stood uncovered, awed by the glorious
majesty around him. As I looked at
him, I felt a still stronger yearning for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">[54]</span>
something higher and nobler. That hour,
I am persuaded, was a turning-point in
my life. New hopes fluttered into being;
new resolves were registered; new purposes
were to be maintained; and a
strong confidence was born within me,
that the Lord would not leave me desolate.</p>

<p>Mr. Kirby talked of God&#8217;s exceeding
great love, and how he never turned any
away, even the poorest and weakest,
that might call upon him for aid. He
also told me several wonderful things of
the mountains, and the transformation
continually going on in them; and then
of Hugh Miller, and the ways by which
he had achieved his great work.</p>

<p>It surprises me now, when I think how
much was crowded into that one day.
It was to me like a new revelation; the
very air was full of a new life; I breathed
freer than I had done for months. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">[55]</span>
new path was opening, and I felt strong
to tread where others had gone before&mdash;others
as poor and friendless as I was.
Oh that we could always keep ourselves
on the mountain heights of faith and
hope.</p>

<p>With Mr. Kirby near to prompt and
encourage me, I forgot my ragged clothes
and rimless hat, and that my shoes were
old and patched&mdash;forgot, or rather did
not know, that to become learned as he
was would require years of time and a
great deal of money, a commodity that I
knew little about. My heart was light
and buoyant. I thought I could do it,
and hope began to trill a measure that
was henceforth to ring on all through
my life.</p>

<p>The sudden shower had rendered fresh
and green each leaf and flower, while the
bright sun-rays had transmuted the drops
to brilliant diamonds, suspended in lavish<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">[56]</span>
profusion from tree and shrub, catching
and reflecting its light in countless
forms of splendor.</p>

<p>Just then a wren flew out of a thicket,
and settled on a low spray just in our
path. With a sweep of my hand I could
have reached the fearless little songster,
fresh, bright, glad, offering its tribute to
the Creator.</p>

<p>&#8220;Shall not we thank him too?&#8221; said
Mr. Kirby; and suiting the action to the
word, he knelt, and placing one hand
upon my bowed head, implored God, for
Christ&#8217;s sake, to have compassion upon
me, to make me a child of God, to forgive
my sins, and to give me a teachable
spirit, that I might be willing to be
led, and might, through the influence of
his grace, grow up to be a good and useful
man.</p>

<p>This was the first time that anybody
had ever prayed alone with me, save<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">[57]</span>
my mother; and it brought her so forcibly
before me, that I could not keep
down the sobs.</p>

<p>Going home, I asked Mr. Kirby if we
should ever see him again.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not probable,&#8221; he answered.
&#8220;It is very possible that I may be sent
abroad; and if so, we may never meet
again; but whether we meet or not, I
shall think of you, Marston, and pray
that we may both live so as to meet in
heaven.&#8221;</p>

<p>Jennie saw us coming, and bounded
over the brook that ran at the back of the
house and across the pasture to meet us,
breaking out into a glad welcome, telling
us that she had finished the book, and
nearly hemmed the handkerchief. &#8220;Here
it is,&#8221; holding it up for inspection.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well done,&#8221; said Mr. Kirby,
shaking it out, and examining it attentively.
&#8220;Now, my little friends, I want<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">[58]</span>
you both to remember this day. It may
be the last chance I shall have to speak
to you alone. Do your duty wherever
you are. Let your first question be, Is
it right? and then never turn back, nor
be discouraged. Do this, and you will
advance, just as we did in climbing the
mountain to-day, one step at a time; so
by one act of duty at a time, one good
purpose well carried out, success will follow.&#8221;
Then putting his hand on each of
our heads, &#8220;Give your hearts to Christ
now; love and serve him. Wherever I
go, I shall think of you, and shall hope
you are workers for him, let your surroundings
be what they may.&#8221;</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">III.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Full</span> of my new resolves, I went about
my evening&#8217;s work, followed closely by
Jennie, telling me all the time about her
book. While listening to the charming
story, I forgot, and put brindle into the
black cow&#8217;s place. No sooner done, than
Mr. Jeffries, who had a quick eye, sent
me spinning across the stable floor, and
Jennie into the house and up to her attic,
where I found her an hour afterwards,
with tears still on her cheeks.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cry about it, Jennie;&#8221; and I
drew up a little rocking-chair I had made
for her out of an old one, and took her in
my arms. &#8220;It was careless in me; I
should have seen what I was about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;He said afterwards it would not have
been much matter if the cattle had remained<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">[60]</span>
so all night. Oh, if we only had
a home, like other children, Marston. I
wonder why we haven&#8217;t;&#8221; and she nestled
her brown head on my shoulder,
and tried hard not to sob any more.
Just then a sharp voice came up from
the kitchen, and for once I felt like resisting.
I was tired, my work was all
done, and I sat quite still, holding Jennie
tightly. Again and again the call.</p>

<p>&#8220;We must go, brother; Mr. Kirby
said we must do what we have to do
well, and then God will open a path for
us. I do hope he will; don&#8217;t you?&#8221;
Kissing my angry cheek, she put away
her book, and ran down the narrow stairs.
Brushing off the tears, I followed as
quickly as possible.</p>

<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve forgotten your wood, boy;
this comes of reading books. If you
don&#8217;t quit it, you can&#8217;t stay here, I can
tell you;&#8221; and Mr. Jeffries stormed till<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">[61]</span>
he was tired, and then walked into the
bar-room.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t mind his being cross, Marston,&#8221;
said Mrs. Jeffries soothingly; &#8220;he&#8217;s
not quite himself to-night; to-morrow
he&#8217;ll be sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>Tired as I was at bedtime I could
not sleep, the day had been so pleasant
notwithstanding the fatigue. I had listened
to Mr. Kirby, and thought it would
be easy to be good; and then he had
prayed that I might be led. But before
my work was done I had become angry
and cross, and half questioning God&#8217;s
goodness because Jennie and I had not a
home, with some one to love and take
care of us.</p>

<p>I went to the window where I could
see the distant hills, the very mountain
the top of which we had reached by continued
effort. &#8220;Nothing is gained without
labor,&#8221; Mr. Kirby had said. How<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">[62]</span>
easy it would be to do right, I thought,
if we could always live with such people;
and I looked up to the stars twinkling to
each other in their beauty.</p>

<p>My heart was full, and yearned for
sympathy; and to comfort myself, I went
back and lived the cheering scenes of
my life over again&mdash;calling up every
word and look of my dear mother, then
all Mr. Brisbane had said, and now Mr.
Kirby, and my books, of which I could
count several.</p>

<p>In going up the mountain Mr. Kirby
had often caused me to look behind me,
in that way getting an idea of the ascent
we were really making. So in looking
over the past I could see that I had
made some advance, and insensibly my
thoughts grew clearer. Again I looked
up to the heavens; but I knew but little
of God&#8217;s love. His precious promise was
to me then a sealed voice. Still, there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">[63]</span>
was a feeling of quiet stole over me, something
that spoke comfort, for I went to
sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning Mr. Kirby left, and
I had so much to do, and so many calling
upon me at once, that I had no time
to tell him what I had resolved to tell
him, namely, how forgetful I had been,
and what a passionate feeling had swept
over me. I meant to try and do better,
but I had no time to tell him.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do right, Marston, and study all you
can,&#8221; had been his last words. Mr. Jeffries
was very kind, and as if to make
amends for the last night, gave me an
hour to myself after dinner. Taking our
books, Jennie followed me to a flat rock
under a gnarled apple-tree, and on a
broken slate I pored over my sums, while
she studied geography. Then I heard
her lesson, and she questioned me in
arithmetic; for with less instruction she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">[64]</span>
was further advanced than I was. After
that, we read the book Mr. Kirby had
given her. It was a simple, unvarnished
sketch of every-day life, with allusions
that I could understand, and experiences
so like my own that more than once
I stopped to dry my eyes.</p>

<p>We had just finished, and were talking
it over, when who should come across
the garden but our father? We had not
seen him in a good while, and there was
something so kind in his look and manner,
that we started at once to meet
him.</p>

<p>&#8220;So you have not quite forgotten me,&#8221;
he said, as Jennie kissed him and I clung
to his hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can never do that, pa.&#8221; He sat
down on the rock and held us to him,
with his arms close around us.</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you willing to come home, Marston?
You are getting to be a large<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">[65]</span>
boy, and can help me now; and I am
going to try to do better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Had it not been for my new mother I
should have jumped at the idea of going
with my father; but when I thought of
her my heart struggled against it. Again
Mr. Kirby&#8217;s words came to my mind:
&#8220;Do right, Marston.&#8221; Something told
me it was right, if my father was trying
to make a better man, to help him. So
I answered resolutely,</p>

<p>&#8220;If you think it best, father; but I
want to go to school, and do something
better by and by.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I want you to do, my
son; and I will try and help you.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was sober, and spoke so kindly, we
both cried when he kissed us good-by,
and said he knew he had not been as
good to us as he ought to have been since
we had no mother. Dear father, it was
a long time since we had seen him so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">[66]</span>
kind; and it was to be a still longer time
before we should see him so kind again.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will come down to-morrow night,
children.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, father.&#8221;</p>

<p>This arrangement did not suit Mr. Jeffries;
but he said nothing against it, while
his wife shook her head. &#8220;The same old
story; it will be as bad as ever in a
week,&#8221; she said to herself.</p>

<p>The next day, the last we stayed at the
Jeffries&#8217;, a traveller presented me with a
book entitled &#8220;Self Helps,&#8221; and never a
miser rejoiced more over his treasure
than I did when I caught sight of its contents.
So there had been hosts of poor
boys trying just as I was for something
better; and at last they found it; so
should I.</p>

<p>At sunset Jennie and I walked back
to our old home. Our new mother received
us kindly, and the baby crowed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">[67]</span>
and clapped his hands, seeming to regard
us as old acquaintances.</p>

<p>The days and weeks passed, and it was
the middle of autumn. There was a little
corn to be gathered, and a few potatoes
to be dug; but father&#8217;s good promises
had all vanished. He was not cross,
neither did he often scold, but he stayed
from home; and when he was there, he
was too stupid to care for any of us.</p>

<p>Winter came, and I attended a school
nearly a mile from us; but this time we
had no such friend as Charles Brisbane.
The teacher seemed to know that we were
poor and miserable; and when I went
in late, as I almost always did, he was
sure to give me a sharp reprimand. In
vain it was to rise at four o&#8217;clock: there
was fire to make, there were paths to
shovel, the cow to milk, and breakfast to
get; for my new mother would not rise
until the room was warm, and this in our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">[68]</span>
house could not be till the fire had been
burning a good while.</p>

<p>Poor little Jennie had to stay at home
entirely. Still she studied, and Miss
Grimshaw out of the kindness of her
heart sent us each a slate for her Christmas
present. Never were more acceptable
gifts, and I question if any Christmas
since has brought us more pleasure,
brightened as it was by two new
slates.</p>

<p>The winter proved to be unusually
severe; the snow deeper than for years.
We managed to live, how I hardly know.
There was plenty of wood that could be
had for the cutting; but I had not sufficient
strength to accomplish much in this
way, and had to content myself with
drawing up fallen timber, and branches
that the wind had scattered. Towards
spring, father was gone more than ever,
sometimes not coming home till late at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">[69]</span>
night; and then not till Jennie and I had
taken the lantern and gone down to the
village after him.</p>

<p>One night he was later than usual;
the day had been unusually bleak, a
heavy snow-storm setting in before noon,
and by sunset we could hardly wade
through it. Ten o&#8217;clock, and our mother
for the first time grew uneasy; the baby
was asleep; she left Jennie to rock the
cradle, and giving me the lantern, we
started for the village.</p>

<p>We had not made half the distance
before we were covered with such a thick
mantle of snow as to render it necessary
to stop and shake ourselves; but my
step-mother had a resolute will, when
she chose to put it in force. In vain I
counselled her to return, and let me go
alone; finding she could not be persuaded,
I waded through, making as good a
path as possible, holding up my lantern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">[70]</span>
so that father could see it if he was really
on the way.</p>

<p>It was twelve o&#8217;clock when we reached
the village; the lights were nearly all
out, only one room was open, and that
was the fatal one that tempted him so
often from home.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, your father is not here,&#8221; they
said in answer to my inquiries. &#8220;He
started for home before night. It is such
a terrible storm, he may have stopped on
the way.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;More likely that he has fallen in the
snow,&#8221; said mother; &#8220;it is frightfully
cold, and the wind is drifting it in
heaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>There were few words spoken as we
went back. The storm had somewhat
subsided, and far as the eye could reach
spread out before us one mass of fleecy
whiteness.</p>

<p>How our hearts thrilled, and then<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">[71]</span>
stood still, as we passed an eminence
where the snow lay high and uneven:
under that white covering father might
be buried.</p>

<p>&#8220;Here is an uneven track,&#8221; and mother
pointed to a pile of snow at the foot
of the hill, and very near our own door.
I held up the lantern, but for a moment
could not move onward. So near us, and
still we had gone so far! Nerving myself
at last, I followed the steps, now filled
with snow, but still perceptible.</p>

<p>It was as we feared. He had started
for home, and had reached the foot of the
hill, when he fell, too chilled or too insensible
to rise.</p>

<p>Oh the agony of that night! He was
our father, and deeply as he had erred,
we loved him. Such a terrible death,
and we knew not where to look for comfort.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">IV.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Jennie</span> and I were alone now, for our
new mother had taken her babe and gone
back to her parents. What could we do?
I thought of others who had worked out
of just such extremities, and resolved that
I would seek employment, but not of Mr.
Jeffries.</p>

<p>So making myself as tidy as possible,
and curling Jennie&#8217;s hair over my fingers
as I had seen my own mother do, we shut
the door of our mountain home, and walked
resolutely down to the village. Sure
of success, I kept Jennie laughing as I
portrayed the future in glowing colors,
telling her of all that I would do, and the
pretty home that I would make of my
own, where we would always live together,
with plenty of books and flowers&mdash;her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">[73]</span>
sweet blue eyes looking up with such
a glad earnestness.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be better than the story in
the book, wont it?&#8221;</p>

<p>Our first call was on Miss Grimshaw.
She was a milliner in the village, and her
one shop window was full of pictures of
highly dressed women, whose feathers,
bonnets, and flowers made a great impression
upon her customers, to say nothing
of the awe Jennie and I felt in the
presence of such magnificence.</p>

<p>Miss Grimshaw received us very cordially;
and when I told her we wanted
work together, she shook her head.</p>

<p>After thinking a while, she said with
sincere tenderness, &#8220;Jennie had better
stay with me. She is too delicate to do
heavy work; I will give her a light task,
and let her have several hours to study
every day: and it is very probable that
you can find employment in the village;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">[74]</span>
so it will not be much of a separation.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was soon settled that Jennie should
remain with Miss Grimshaw; and I went
to look out for myself elsewhere. Fortunately
the grocer who lived directly opposite
wanted a boy; and after examining
me a little in arithmetic, and also asking
me to write his name and my own, he
finally said,</p>

<p>&#8220;You may try, although I will not
promise to keep you a single day.&#8221;</p>

<p>Every little village has its great man;
and the village of Claverton, nestled at
the foot of the green hills, was not without
its rich man, Esquire Clavers being
the original proprietor from whom it took
its name.</p>

<p>He was a little wiry man, with sparkling
eyes and a hooked nose, spare thin
hair, and whiskers thickly sprinkled
with grey, and a voice that sounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">[75]</span>
any thing but musical, especially to the
poor.</p>

<p>Very precise in his toilet was Esquire
Clavers; his linen was always unexceptionable,
his watch chain of the largest
dimensions, and from it dangled a massive
seal and gold key, while his gold-headed
cane seemed almost a part of himself, for
never was he seen without it. He lived
in a two-story yellow house at the head of
the principal street, and the people looked
up to him with a deferential air given to
no other person, not even the minister.</p>

<p>Mr. Willett, the grocery keeper, was
the next on the list; and it not unfrequently
happened, as his front shop was
the largest one in town, that it proved
the rendezvous for politicians and news-mongers&mdash;Esquire
Clavers being of course
the main speaker in the assembly, and
the oracle in matters of opinion in all
Claverton.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">[76]</span>It was spring, but not yet sufficiently
warm to do without fires; accordingly
there was a trio around the stove the
very morning I commenced my work.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see you&#8217;ve got a new boy,&#8221; said
Jared Peat the tailor.</p>

<p>&#8220;On trial just,&#8221; answered Mr. Willett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not of much account, I&#8217;ll venture; a
chip of the old block,&#8221; continued Jared.</p>

<p>&#8220;Smart as a steel-trap,&#8221; said Esquire
Clavers, &#8220;but altogether too fine notions
in his head. If a boy would be any thing,
he must work for it. It&#8217;s of no use
trying to work and study too; one or the
other will be done badly. Jeffries was
telling me of his being there; he could
hardly take a horse to water without
having a book along to read while the
horse was drinking. For my part, I
wouldn&#8217;t give him his salt if he works in
that manner.&#8221; Esquire Clavers had said
it, and of course I should find little time<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">[77]</span>
for books so long as I should be in Mr.
Willett&#8217;s employ.</p>

<p>I had heard that Esquire Clavers had
once been poor, and I could not but ask
myself, Has he forgotten? or was it not
so dark and hard to him as it is to me?</p>

<p>Presently a customer asked for molasses,
and I went into the back room to
draw it, Mr. Willett hastening after me.</p>

<p>&#8220;You should not fill the measure quite
full, boy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She asked for a quart, sir;&#8221; and I
looked up, feeling sure he had not understood,
as I held but a quart measure.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know, but we never fill it quite
full; it might run over, you know; and
when you stop it, see that not a drop is
lost.&#8221;</p>

<p>He walked about, apparently finding
something to do, but in reality watching
me. I saw the direction of his eye; and
filling my measure, with care that it did<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">[78]</span>
not run over, and that not a drop was
lost, I emptied it into the poor woman&#8217;s
jug.</p>

<p>&#8220;Never stop to drain it; make quick
work; somebody else will want you;&#8221;
and I followed him into the front room.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see he gives good measure,&#8221; Mr.
Willett said to Jared Peat as he resumed
his place at the fire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes, such people are always honest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know about that,&#8221; answered
Esquire Clavers. &#8220;His father was an
honest man, though open-handed and
generous, and I have heard say was at
one time a gentleman. It&#8217;s a pity he
drank so.&#8221;</p>

<p>They did not seem to mind me at all,
and still I felt pleased, although saddened,
to hear my father called an honest
man, and that at one time he had
been in better circumstances. Thus<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">[79]</span>
thinking, and wishing that I knew more
of his early life, I leaned against the
counter, and weighed and tied up sundry
packages; for this was, Mr. Willett
said, my first work, to tie packages handsomely.</p>

<p>On the day went. My hands were
not idle, yet not unfrequently I found my
thoughts straying into the future. The
vision loomed up with a sudden brightness,
a path tending onward in spite of
difficulties and temptations.</p>

<p>I did not know what trials would rise
up from unseen places, what snares and
pitfalls where the flowers grew brightest.
But I remembered Mr. Kirby had said,
as he climbed the mountain, &#8220;One step
at a time; and so in life. Do what you
have to do well, and God will open a
path to something better.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did I then see what He was to
do for me; little did I then understand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">[80]</span>
my duty to him; but I thought of him,
and felt a certain sense of reliance, a feeling
of security, which I have since vainly
endeavored to understand.</p>

<p>Near sunset, and just as I was balancing
the question, wishing and still fearing
to ask Mr. Willett&#8217;s permission to
study in the evening, Jennie came in,
her bright, happy face looking still prettier
in a light blue sun-bonnet that Miss
Grimshaw had given her. I had only
time for a kiss when she asked for Mr.
Willett. I showed her to his desk, when
she stepped forward and laid a tiny note
before him. I saw that his face lit up
with a glad surprise, and his eyes sparkled
with pleasure as he laid it down.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, tell her I&#8217;ll come.&#8221; I afterwards
discovered it was an invitation to
tea. Mr. Willett was a devoted admirer,
and the little milliner held his heart
as he did his purse, tightly. What was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">[81]</span>
said I never knew; but the next morning
Mr. Willett said if I was faithful and
did my work well, I could study every
evening with Jennie, and Miss Grimshaw
would hear our lessons.</p>

<p>That night was an era in my life, and
very happy and hopeful was I as I
crossed the street to the little side door
Jennie had told me to enter. Here I
found a comfortable room, a round table
in the centre of the floor, with our two
slates, an arithmetic, and geography; for
Jennie had every thing in readiness, including
a tallow candle in a white porcelain
holder, the bottom shaped like a
leaf, which Jennie thought was a marvel
of beauty. In the corner was seated
grandma Grimshaw, a stately looking
woman with silver hair combed low on
the forehead, white muslin cap with long
embroidered tabs, and spectacles.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is Marston,&#8221; said she, taking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">[82]</span>
my hand as I came in. &#8220;I&#8217;ve heard
Eliza speak of you as a good boy. She
used to know your ma;&#8221; and soon Miss
Grimshaw came out of the front room,
laid her hand on my head, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;You shall study two hours if you
like, and then I will hear your lesson.&#8221;
I tried to stammer out my thanks, but
something choked down my words. &#8220;That
is nothing, Marston. I used to want to
study, but I had no chance. I like to
read, and I am familiar with arithmetic;
I can help you there as well as any one;&#8221;
and she was gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;Eliza don&#8217;t get much time,&#8221; said her
mother; &#8220;but she likes to help others;
and she used to think so much of your
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>Brushing away the tears that would
come at the mention of my mother, I
turned to my slate. The first three rules
I could understand perfectly, but long<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">[83]</span>
division troubled me. I was sure to
make some mistake that would require
me to go over and over again, and not
unfrequently did I feel inclined to throw
it aside. But one look at my &#8220;Self
Helps,&#8221; and I worked away as resolutely
as ever.</p>

<p>At nine Miss Grimshaw came in, heard
Jennie&#8217;s lesson in geography, then questioned
me in arithmetic, and explained
till the difficulties had all vanished. Then
we read for half an hour; at the expiration
of which she shut our books.</p>

<p>&#8220;I promised Mr. Willett you should
be there five minutes before ten.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is better than the boy in the
book,&#8221; said Jennie, reaching up on tiptoe
to kiss me good-night.</p>

<p>It had been a busy day and evening,
and I was tired. Still I had made some
advance, and at this rate it would not be
long before I should master arithmetic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">[84]</span>
I slept in a little back room; but weary
as I was, I could not at once quiet my
thoughts; so I lay and watched one little
star as it stole across my window,
and wondered if my mother could know
how and where I was, and that I did try
to care for Jennie, although we could not
sleep under the same roof.</p>

<p>As spring came forward, the ordinary
business of the day remained quite the
same, but how many pleasant things I
had to think of. Long division did not
trouble me any more, neither did fractions;
I was beginning to understand
interest, and my handwriting had much
improved. There was also a sensible
difference in my outward appearance,
and Jennie grew in loveliness each day.
How proud I was of that little sister;
and never did we go to church or Sabbath-school,
but I wondered if mother
could know it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">[85]</span>When the summer heats were on us
there was less to do, and sometimes I
got a walk with Jennie among the hills.
A year had made a great difference with
both of us, while the mountain was just
the same; and we often thought of our
last walk there, and of dear Mr. Kirby.</p>

<p>&#8220;If he could only know how kind
Miss Grimshaw is to us,&#8221; said Jennie.
&#8220;It is God that puts it into her heart,
isn&#8217;t it? and not for our sakes, but for
Christ&#8217;s sake. I used to think it was for
mother&#8217;s sake; but Christ died for us.&#8221;</p>

<p>Dear little comforter; her heart was
full of sweet thoughts, while I was ambitious
for her; and this, together with
Mr. Kirby&#8217;s words, kept me from being
gloomy and desponding when I fancied
Mr. Willett was impatient or exacting:
&#8220;Do your work well, and God will open
a path to something better.&#8221; This gave
me courage and strength; so that while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">[86]</span>
I worked in the present, I lived in the
future.</p>

<p>One day I was sent to Esquire Clavers&#8217;
with a basket of groceries he had ordered.
As I went up the walk, Frank, his oldest
son, a boy of about my own age, was on
the piazza, a spot embowered in roses
and honeysuckles, reading; a little girl
in a blue lawn dress, with long golden
curls framing her face like a picture,
reclined near him, her head resting on
the neck of a large Newfoundland dog.
From the open window the pleasant
tones of a piano floated out on the air,
and involuntarily I stopped to listen.
Frank looked up, and seeing me, came
down the avenue to meet me.</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you here? Oh, teas and
things for mother. Do you like music?
Come, go in and hear sister play.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should be glad to,&#8221; I answered,
&#8220;but I was told to return immediately.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">[87]</span>&#8220;Five minutes wont be missed; come
in.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now, Frank,&#8221; for I thought of
what Mr. Kirby had said; and handing
my basket to the servant, I took up
Frank&#8217;s book.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;Latin,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and a grand
old language it is;&#8221; and he began reading
aloud.</p>

<p>&#8220;Where do you go to school?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;To the Rockdale academy. Have
you never heard of it? It is vacation
now. We shall commence again in September.
Oh, we have great times there.
I wish you would join us; you&#8217;d like the
boys: some of them study, and some are
up to all sorts of fun.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish I could go,&#8221; I answered musingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, why can&#8217;t you? it&#8217;s only four
miles from here.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">[88]</span>I did not dare stay another moment;
and taking my basket, I turned, with a
hasty good-by to Frank. Since the vacation
commenced, he had visited the
grocery almost every day, and very fond
he seemed of all sports and amusements.</p>

<p>This boy has a home, I said to myself
sadly, and parents to watch over him;
he does not have to look after himself;
and his little sister is no better than
Jennie; and again I dared to question
why Frank Clavers had so much, and
we were so destitute. But whatever
feelings swayed me for the moment, the
controlling idea was still the same: &#8220;Do
what you do well, and God will open a
path.&#8221;</p>

<p>Even then God was preparing a surprise
that would melt me into tears.
For several days Miss Grimshaw had
been saying that I was getting all she
knew of arithmetic; and when September<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">[89]</span>
came, she surprised me by asking
how I would like to go to the Rockdale
academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, so much, Miss Grimshaw; but it
is four miles from here, and&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is only three miles by the river
road, which is by far the pleasantest.
Three miles is not such a long walk for
a boy like you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh no, Miss Grimshaw; but you
forget there is no school at night.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are not going at night, but in the
morning early;&#8221; and my white face, as
she told me afterwards, frightened her
into exclaiming at once,</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Jeffries says that she will board
you; that is, she will send me enough
during the winter of such things as we
need to pay the expense of your board;
and you are to go to Rockdale.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had no words, and Jennie seated herself
on my knee, and kissed away the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">[90]</span>
tears. &#8220;I am so glad, brother; I only
wish I could go too.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The walk is entirely too long for
Jennie,&#8221; said Miss Grimshaw, who overheard
the last remark; &#8220;but you can
help her some, and in this way she will
advance nearly as well as though at
school all the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall get on very nicely. I cannot
sufficiently thank you, Miss Grimshaw.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not all my work, Marston. Mrs.
Jeffries had quite as much to do with it;
she is anxious that you should both go to
school.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">A great</span> day it was when I started for
the academy. With the amount received
from Mr. Willett, Miss Grimshaw had
provided me with a neat outfit, and also
had enough left for a few new books.</p>

<p>&#8220;I used to have a little brother,&#8221; said
Miss Grimshaw as we set out; for the
night previous, she had announced her
intention of going with me. &#8220;Had Johnny
lived, he would have been about your
own age. We always intended to send
him to college; for he loved books.&#8221;</p>

<p>But it was not a morning to be sad.
A soft hazy atmosphere floated around
us, and softened into beauty the distant
landscape. The hills stretching away
northward loomed up through their blue
veil with almost the majesty of mountain<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">[92]</span>
ranges; the green of the pines on
their crests, and the ragged lines of the
wood which marked the courses of the
descending ravines, were dimmed and
robbed of their gloom. The valley was
still fresh, and the great oaks by the
brook had not yet shed all their tawny
leaves. A moist and fragrant odor of
decay pervaded the air, and the soft
south wind occasionally stealing along
the valley seemed to blow the sombre
colors of the landscape into long-continued
waves of brightness.</p>

<p>The hills, curving rapidly to the eastward,
rose abruptly from the meadows
in a succession of terraces, the lowest of
which was faced with a wall of dark rock,
in horizontal strata, but almost concealed
from view by the tall forest-trees which
grew at the base.</p>

<p>The brook, issuing from a glen which
descended from the lofty upland region,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">[93]</span>
poured itself headlong from the brink of
the rocky steep, a glittering silver thread.
Seen through the hazy atmosphere, its
narrow white column seemed to stand
motionless between the pines, and its
mellowed mist to roll from some region
beyond the hills.</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall see Rockdale presently,&#8221;
said Miss Grimshaw. &#8220;I am sorry now
that I did not let Jennie come. I did
not think the walk would be so beautiful,
and I was afraid it would make her
sick.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you are willing, I would like to
have her take this walk some time; it
would please her so much; neither do I
think it would tire her. We have both
been accustomed to long walks. I have
been to the top of the highest point, and
Jennie was familiar with almost every
rock about Mrs. Jeffries&#8217;.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;She shall come,&#8221; continued Miss<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">[94]</span>
Grimshaw. &#8220;But there&#8217;s the academy.
It used to be only a private dwelling;
but the owner died, and Mr. Harlan, our
minister then, thought it would be a good
place for a school. Terryville, just beyond,
is much larger than our village,
and most of the boys board there.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time we were near the house,
a white two-story building, with a broad
veranda looking southward from the last
low shelf of the hills, with an ample
school-room in the rear, and grounds
fitted up with arbors, rustic seats, swings,
and all the paraphernalia of school life.
The avenue by which we approached was
lined with maples, and on our advance
we passed clumps of lilacs and snowballs.
But the house itself, with its heavy windows
and flagged walk before the door,
was just the same as before, Miss Grimshaw
said. A few bunches of asters
nodded their welcome, and the chrysanthemums<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">[95]</span>
on the borders stood as erect
as though school-boys never passed them.
We had reached the porch before Mr.
Harlan saw us.</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is Marston Howe,&#8221; he said,
after greeting Miss Grimshaw with marked
kindness. &#8220;I am glad to see you,
Marston; they tell me that you are fond
of books, and determined to study. Is
that so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall do my best, sir,&#8221; was all that
I could say, while it seemed that his eyes
would look me through.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will be a long walk, Mr. Harlan,&#8221;
Miss Grimshaw observed when she rose
to leave. &#8220;I should have been glad on
many accounts could Marston have boarded
here; but for the present we could
not arrange it so.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, as for that matter, the walk will
do him good; the harder one studies, the
more exercise he should have. It will<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">[96]</span>
deprive him of companionship, save his
books; but perhaps that will prove no
loss. It is a delightful walk. I make
the trip sometimes, and always return
well paid for the trouble. I am only
sorry I have so few pupils from your village.
Frank Clavers boards here, and
goes home on Friday.&#8221;</p>

<p>When Miss Grimshaw had gone, Mr.
Harlan led the way into a large room
where several boys and girls were studying.
Taking his seat at the desk, he
motioned me near him, and began questioning
me closely in arithmetic and
geography. When he had finished, he
gave me a lesson in Latin grammar, and
then seated me at his right hand, and
by the side of another pupil, almost man
grown, whom he called Lovell.</p>

<p>He then rung his desk-bell, and through
the several doors came pupils from the
recitation rooms; another touch of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">[97]</span>
bell, and others went out. There was
no voice, no confusion; it was done with
the order and precision of clock-work.</p>

<p>Twelve o&#8217;clock, and then such a buzz
and whirr in the school-room I could
neither see nor think. Soon Frank Clavers
came with a noisy welcome, and led
me out to see a new swing he had just
been improvising, introducing me first
to one and then to another.</p>

<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll know them soon enough,
Marston. I only wish you boarded in
the house; such capital times as we have.
Fridays I go home. I am glad you are
here to go with me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But you do not walk, and I do all
the time.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No matter. I have my pony sent
down, and they can just as well send
another. But say, whom do you sit
with?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harlan called him Lovell.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">[98]</span>&#8220;Lovell! why, he&#8217;s the very best
scholar in school; poor though; going to
be a minister;&#8221; and Frank ran on:
&#8220;There goes the dinner-bell. What have
you for dinner, Marston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall take my dinner after I get
home,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Too bad; I wish you would board
here. Why not?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m too poor, Frank; I am glad to
come on any terms.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a sudden dropping of balls
and jumping from swings, and a general
scudding across the grounds. I walked
around to the south side, and seated myself
in an arbor heavily laden with vines.</p>

<p>It had seemed to me delightful to study
Latin; but the grammar, now that I had
it in my hand, was altogether a different
thing. I thought of the mountain. We
had gone to the top by the simple effort
of one step at a time.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">[99]</span>&#8220;We are all climbers,&#8221; Mr. Kirby had
said. Studying Latin could be done in
the same manner as we scaled the mountain,
with one step at a time. Before I
went home at night my lesson was recited.</p>

<p>&#8220;Very well for the first day,&#8221; said
Mr. Harlan. &#8220;Perseverance and energy
are all that is necessary. You like to
study, and I trust you like to do what
you do well. Make thorough work;
understand what you go over. The great
fault with our scholars is, they are superficial.
It will require time to accomplish
all you desire; but with the right effort
it can be done. Make haste, but make
haste slowly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Owing to my long walk, and my not
having any recitation the first hour, Mr.
Harlan did not oblige me to come in
before ten; and I was also privileged to
leave at three. This would give me some
time to help Jennie; and for myself, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">[100]</span>
knew I should study better in Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s
little back parlor than in the large
school-room at Rockdale.</p>

<p>Returning home, I had just reached
the point where the narrow white line of
a brook became visible, when Jennie
bounded up the pathway, her round
cheeks all aglow, her blue sun-bonnet
thrown back, and the sunshine playing
with the loose meshes of her hair. She
could hardly steady her voice, so eager
was she to know of the day.</p>

<p>&#8220;Tell me all about it, brother. Miss
Grimshaw said Rockdale was such a
lovely place. Oh, I am sure it cannot
be more beautiful there than it is here.
Are there any little girls that go to the
school? Did you see any to-day; and
are there any so small as I am?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not see any so small as you
are, Jennie.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh dear, I do so wish I could go<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">[101]</span>
with you. Don&#8217;t you think I could walk
easily?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not every day, Jennie; and besides,
we are going to study in the evening,
you know; and what I learn at school I
will teach you at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Will you? Oh, that is so good;&#8221;
and she clung to my hand, this little sister
that my mother had said I must love
and care for. Then she drew me down
to the brook, its waters leaping over the
stones with a gurgling music, like the
trill of a laughing child; the sunshine
glinting through the pines and climbing
up the bank to our feet.</p>

<p>It was a scene of peculiar beauty, and
dear Jennie enjoyed it with a keen relish.
I tried, but could not enter into
the same sense of enjoyment. To tell
the truth, I was weary, perhaps hungry,
and my new book did not seem to me
quite as easy as I expected to find it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">[102]</span>Then I recollected that, in climbing
the mountain, the object was not accomplished
by one effort, but by a succession
of continued struggles. It was by pressing
through the undergrowth, catching
hold of the cliff, going around the rocks,
creeping where it was impossible to walk,
yet advancing steadily all the time, that
the ascent was made. Mr. Kirby had
told me it would be just so in my studies;
and I looked above me into the
bright blue sky, and thought of the
prayer offered in that jewelled dell&mdash;the
prayer that I might be led by God&#8217;s
Spirit, guarded and guided by his grace,
and that a path might open for me. It
had opened thus far; and was not this
in answer to Mr. Kirby&#8217;s prayer and my
mother&#8217;s supplications? and again I resolved
to use my time wisely.</p>

<p>The oak grows stronger by the very
winds that toss its boughs; so the heart,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">[103]</span>
from the burdens that apparently weigh
it down, gathers new power to soar above
the mists of gloom and discontent.</p>

<p>&#8220;You have not noticed my book,&#8221; I
said at length, holding out my Latin
grammar; &#8220;and besides, you forget that
I have not been to dinner.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so pleasant here, brother; don&#8217;t
it rest you?&#8221; and her arms were twined
about my neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; but my lesson for to-morrow
will require all my time,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Willett came to see us to-day,&#8221;
said Jennie as we went home. &#8220;He
spoke kindly of you, and said he supposed
you would not want to come back
after you had been to the academy; but
if you did, there would be a place for
you; and he told Miss Grimshaw that if
you needed books, he would get them
for you. He said a good deal more.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps he would rather you would<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">[104]</span>
not repeat it all. Did he know that you
heard?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh yes. It is not wrong to tell what
he said before me, is it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps not; but Mr. Kirby said
that we should not fall into the habit of
repeating what people say, unless necessary
to do so; that in this way much
scandal is floated about, which, had it
not been repeated, would have died out
immediately.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, brother, I did not mean to say
any thing wrong.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Neither have you, Jennie. I thought
at first you probably overheard him.
There is surely no harm in repeating to
me simply what he said before you, especially
when he spoke so kindly.&#8221;</p>

<p>That night there was a happy meeting
in Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s back parlor. Mrs.
Jeffries came down with her first instalment
of eatables on my account; and she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">[105]</span>
met us so warmly, taking Jennie on her
knee, and asking me all the little minuti&aelig;
of school life.</p>

<p>&#8220;You think you will like, then?&#8221; and
she played with my hair in a motherly
way.</p>

<p>&#8220;The only fear is, that I shall have to
stop before I have half accomplished my
desire.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;One step at a time,&#8221; said Miss Grimshaw,
while Jennie was so tired with her
long walk and the unusual excitement of
the day, that she went to sleep with her
head on my shoulder, in the very effort
of trying to master a new lesson.</p>

<p>Friday came, and true to his promise,
Frank Clavers ordered two horses in
the room of one. It was a glorious afternoon,
and as we leaped into the saddle,
I felt a pride in being able to rein in and
manage my horse handsomely. He was
a fine-spirited animal, that Esquire Clavers<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">[106]</span>
kept for his own use. It was to
oblige Frank, of course, that I was permitted
this little indulgence.</p>

<p>Riding was the only thing perhaps
that I could do well, and this I had
learned at Mr. Jeffries&#8217;, and I knew that
here I was superior to the other boys.
So with a questionable pride I cantered
round the grounds, and raised my cap as
I passed the young ladies at the window.
I enjoyed, as I never had done before,
the idea of doing something well; and I
have since learned, what I did not know
then, that skill in horsemanship is considered
by all no mean accomplishment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was handsomely done,&#8221; said
Frank. &#8220;Pray where did you learn to
ride so well?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You never knew perhaps that I lived
two years with Mr. Jeffries. My business
was to assist in the stable. It was
there I learned to ride.&#8221;</p>



<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus111.jpg" alt="" /></div>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">[107]</span>What a race we had down the street,
and how Frank&#8217;s gay laugh resounded
through the valley.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is something to look forward to,
Marston,&#8221; said he as we reined up at his
own door. &#8220;I have never seen Hunter
carry himself better. It&#8217;s all because
you know how to ride. Next week we&#8217;ll
have just such another ride. It&#8217;s glorious.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have enjoyed it intensely,&#8221; I answered,
while a secret sense of shame
crept over me at the idea of being puffed
up because I could ride, when in my
books I knew so very little; and for that
evening I studied harder because of my
foolishness.</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">Autumn</span> had run up her banner of
red and gold, and under the spreading
folds I had walked every day to Rockdale,
and as steadily as the week came
round rode home with Frank Clavers on
Friday, until Hunter came to know me
quite as well as his master. Still, after
the first ride, I had never felt the same
degree of satisfaction. To ride well no
longer seemed to me such a desirable
acquisition. To master my Latin as
readily was now my ambition, and to
this I bent all my energies.</p>

<p>As the winter deepened, the walk to
Rockdale proved as bleak as before it
had been delightful, and the north winds,
sweeping down through the mountain
gorges, made my cheeks and ears tingle.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">[109]</span>
Still I could not afford to lose a day.
Frank was to stay three years, and then
four more in college; but Frank Clavers&#8217;
father was rich, and I was dependent
upon my own toil.</p>

<p>As I looked forward, for the first time
one night I yielded to despondency; my
book closed, and my head fell forward
on the casement. Far above, the bright
stars were shining. It was His hand
that sustained them. He prescribed
their courses, and kept them within their
limits; and although I did not understand
how, I still felt that his watch and
care was over me; and with this feeling
came strength.</p>

<p>Looking back, as we did in going up
the mountain, I could feel that I had
accomplished much; and still it was so
little of what I craved. I needed to be
again reminded that it was by one step
at a time that the summit was reached;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">[110]</span>
and that, had I stood at the foot of the
mountain and attempted to leap up by a
few great efforts, it would never have
been done.</p>

<p>My class-mates were boys accustomed
to school life, and still I knew that some
of them hardly looked in their books till
they came to recite. At first I thought
Mr. Harlan was to blame; they came to
study, and they ought to be made to do
so. Still, I have since found it is not an
easy matter to compel pupils to do what
they do not wish to do, what they will
not do cheerfully. Doubtless he did all
that he could to incite them to study;
and this failing, he allowed them to drift
on, hoping perhaps they would in time
wake up to the responsibility of wisely
improving their time and opportunities.</p>

<p>Another advantage I had gained at
Mr. Jeffries&#8217; was to be seen in my declamation.
To stimulate my memory, I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">[111]</span>
had learned nearly the whole of my
English Reader by heart, and these lessons
I had been in the habit of repeating
to the servants in the kitchen, and sometimes,
if I had a moment&#8217;s leisure, to
myself in the stable. It was in the latter
place that Mr. Jeffries had surprised
me, the mention of which he often made,
sure of a laugh at my expense, and over
which I grew extremely sensitive. As
declamation was a regular weekly exercise
in school, I soon found that the habit
had been of great use to me; not only
could I readily commit to memory, but
there was no feeling of timidity, and I
could speak before others without a
thought of myself, leaving me free to
profit by the suggestions of my teacher.</p>

<p>Prominent in the memory of those
days is my long daily walk, with its frequent
concomitants of deep snows, leaden
skies, and bitter winds. One day when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">[112]</span>
the cold was at its height, Miss Grimshaw
went to the door with me, and
urged me not to think of going to Rockdale.
I had just begun to translate, and
one of my sentences troubled me till rest
seemed impossible; I must go. Neither
could I look for a ride, as grandma suggested.
Action was necessary; and buttoning
my coat closely, I told her I could
easily go, the sun would soon make an
impression. &#8220;It is not half as severe as
some days last week.&#8221;</p>

<p>Accordingly I started; but before I
left the village I was obliged to stop repeating
my lesson aloud; my teeth chattered
and my ears were tingling. I tried
to run, but the stiff frozen snow would
not allow of this extra effort. A half
mile from town I met Dr. Graham.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is too cold to go to Rockdale to-day,
Marston;&#8221; and he opened his buffalo
robes and offered me a seat.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">[113]</span>&#8220;Thank you, Dr. Graham,&#8221; I answered
as well as my chattering teeth would
allow, &#8220;it wont be any worse; I can get
there.&#8221; Again he tried to turn me; but
no, I must recite my lesson, and I needed
explanations; I felt that I could not
wait another day.</p>

<p>On I went, the wind rushing and roaring
through the leafless branches of the
trees. I rubbed my ears with my mittens,
while my feet were so numb I could
hardly walk. Midway I began to fear
that I should actually perish. Should I
go back, or should I go on? I glanced
at the mountain, with the proud consciousness
that I had been to the top.
&#8220;Never give up,&#8221; Mr. Kirby said. It
was my duty to go to school. I had
started; I would go.</p>

<p>I gave one glance at the marble column
of the waterfall, with its sculptured
ridges and diamond points, the feathery<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">[114]</span>
spray caught up and congealed, standing
out in bold relief against the clear blue
sky, more beautiful than art could ever
hope to imitate. It was worth a great
effort to look upon such a winter picture
and I sprang forward with renewed energy,
trying to forget my numbed feet
and frozen fingers.</p>

<p>It was harder than I had imagined,
however. All the tales I have since
read of suffering on account of cold, seem
only a dim outline of what I then experienced.
As I left the hollow I met
Philip Allen with his wood-sled. He
had a small load, and was going home
as fast as he could goad on his oxen.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never saw such a day as this,&#8221; said
Philip; &#8220;you had better get on to the
sled.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I should freeze standing still,&#8221; I answered.
&#8220;I must go on now;&#8221; and I
began to feel sorry that I had started.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">[115]</span>
It was indeed a terrible day. My father
had fallen in the snow. What if it should
be my fate too?</p>

<p>&#8220;Never give up,&#8221; said I to myself,
and I felt that I should like to have Mr.
Kirby know that I was trying. At length
I became aware of a new sensation stealing
over me: it was with difficulty I
could put one foot before the other; the
beauty was fading out of the sky; I
only wished to lie down in the snow. I
forgot that I was going to school; strange
shapes floated round me, while strains
of sweet music soothed and quieted me.
I was no longer cold, but, lapped in a
delicious dream, seemed to be floating
towards a palace of dazzling splendor.</p>

<p>The next that I remember, I was in a
nice warm room. It was not the school-room,
although Mr. and Mrs. Harlan
stood beside me. My coat was off, and
the good woman was rubbing my hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">[116]</span>
in her own. Then I saw there were
others present, and that not only my
hands, but my whole body had been
rubbed vigorously. I was suffering a
terrible stinging pain.</p>

<p>&#8220;Drink this,&#8221; said Mrs. Harlan, as a
bowl of hot tea was handed me; &#8220;it will
help you to get warm.&#8221; More to please
her than from any other feeling, I drained
it off, and ere long felt a genial glow
through all my members.</p>

<p>Seeing that the danger was over, Mr.
Harlan went to the school-room; and at
noon all the boys and some of the girls
crowded around me. Such a crying and
shaking of hands! And then I learned
how near to death I had come.</p>

<p>Jerry, the Irish man of all work, had
seen me stagger along, and finally fall.
His kind Irish heart told him at once it
was the cold, and springing down the
road, he carried me in his arms to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">[117]</span>
kitchen, from which Mrs. Harlan had me
taken at once to her own room.</p>

<p>&#8220;To think of your coming to school
such a day, when we that live in the
house can hardly study at all,&#8221; said
Henry Alden. Robert Lovell, however,
said, &#8220;I can understand it: you could
not have stayed at home, had you tried.
I went one winter nearly as far; but it
was not so cold; neither was the snow so
deep as this winter.&#8221;</p>

<p>I recited my lesson in Mrs. Harlan&#8217;s
room; and it seemed to me Mr. Harlan
was never so kind before. He gave me
all the explanations that I needed, and
in such a manner that I understood perfectly.</p>

<p>&#8220;I trust we shall not have another
such a day; but if we do, you must not
expose yourself in this way again. Promise
me;&#8221; and he took both my hands.
&#8220;It is too great a risk.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">[118]</span>&#8220;If you say so,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;but I
shall not like to stay at home.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will study, and I shall not mark
you as absent without cause.&#8221;</p>

<p>As I was taking my books and making
ready to start for home, Mr. Harlan said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Jerry will take you home in his
sleigh; he has an errand down, and it
wont trouble him at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Harlan brought out a pair of fur
mittens and slipped over mine, and got
me a large grey shawl that protected me
entirely.</p>

<p>&#8220;You need not return them,&#8221; said the
sweet-voiced woman; &#8220;I have been
looking all winter for somebody that
needed them.&#8221; She shook me warmly
by the hand, and Mr. Harlan saw me
down to the sleigh.</p>

<p>&#8220;No right effort is ever lost, Marston;
you aim to do what you do well and
faithfully, and God will open a path for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">[119]</span>
you when he sees that you can do something
better, depend upon it, my son.
Thank him for sparing your life, and
devote it to his service.&#8221;</p>

<p>The buffalo robe was nicely tucked
around me, and the grey shawl pulled
over my head; and feeling for my books,
to make sure that I had them, we started.</p>

<p>&#8220;Niver saw the like of such a day,&#8221;
said Jerry. &#8220;If I had not seen you in the
morning&mdash; It was about ten you fell.&#8221;
Again I shuddered, and thought of my
poor dead father, as near our home as I
was to the academy; and in that blinding
storm we failed to see him.</p>

<p>The next day was Saturday; and as I
sat in Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s back room, petted
a little more than usual by Jennie
and grandma, I thought of Mr. Harlan&#8217;s
words, &#8220;No right effort is ever lost.&#8221;
And it seemed that I could hear again
Mr. Kirby&#8217;s voice, &#8220;Whatever you do,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">[120]</span>
do well, and God will open a path to
something better.&#8221; Since then they have
come to me often in characters of light,
to brighten my darkest hours. They have
helped me labor on. When my heart
was sore with heaviness, they have aided
me in adhering to the right in despite of
ridicule and temptation.</p>

<p>&#8220;No right effort is ever lost.&#8221; &#8220;Do
what you do well, and God will open a
path to you, when he sees that you can
do something better.&#8221; Bind the sentiment
to your heart, if you are a patient
climber, and take courage. But I had
not yet found the way to the Source of
all strength, nor learned the secret of the
only true and noble life.</p>

<p>At the close of the term, in February,
we had an examination. This was new
to me, and caused me no little uneasiness.
I had never been through with
such a day, and as a matter of course I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">[121]</span>
felt not a little frightened at the idea of
being questioned before such a crowd as
the boys told me always came. Mr. and
Mrs. Harlan were very kind and patient
teachers, and I was so fresh and new in
my studies, that I trembled in view of
the blunders I felt sure I should make
before strangers and critics.</p>

<p>&#8220;All Terryville will be here,&#8221; said
Henry Alden; &#8220;but then you need not
mind: you are the best one we have in
arithmetic, and history too; and as for
your Latin, why you are only a beginner;
they wont expect much; and in declamation
you know you will take the lead.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But I have never spoken before so
many.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s nothing; you&#8217;ll get accustomed
to it in a few times. We don&#8217;t
mind it a feather. It a&#8217;n&#8217;t half of them
that know.&#8221;</p>

<p>The day came. Miss Grimshaw and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">[122]</span>
Jennie rode with Mr. Willett in a nice
sleigh, with a double set of bells. Then
there was Mr. Farnham and Mr. Wentworth,
ministers from Terryville, with
Dr. Graham and Dr. Stiles, and several
grey-haired men with gold-bowed glasses
and ivory-headed canes, and with books
in their hands, evidently ready to criticize
closely.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the way they always do,&#8221;
said Henry; &#8220;but if you could peep
over their shoulders, ten chances to one
their books are wrong side up.&#8221;</p>

<p>Calm and composed, Henry Alden
made his comments. He was an amiable,
kindly-disposed lad, but caring nothing
for study. Still he managed to get
along, and examination-days had no terrors
for him. His easy, nonchalant air
surprised me, and still more the light
opinion he had formed of the learning of
some of the visitors.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">[123]</span>Around the sides of the room sat the
ladies from Terryville; but to me there
was no face that looked kinder than Miss
Grimshaw&#8217;s, no beauty that began to
equal my little sister Jennie&#8217;s.</p>

<p>At eleven o&#8217;clock the class that had
finished arithmetic were called. I felt
the blood rushing over me at fever heat,
my fingers tingling, and my cheeks burning.
Mr. Farnham questioned us, giving
examples to each. The first sum he
gave me was in interest, the second in the
cube root. I did not tremble from fear
that I could not do the examples, as I
knew perfectly well there was not a sum
in the book I could not do; but I wanted
to do it easily, handsomely, and in order.
I gave a quick glance to Jennie, and the
calm expression of the sweet face swept
away all trepidation. I crossed the platform,
and took up the crayon. Never
was I more collected; I forgot there<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">[124]</span>
were others in the room; I only saw
Jennie, and I knew by the expression
of her quiet face that she expected me
to do well. She would be disappointed
if I failed. I would not fail. There was
no reason why I should.</p>

<p>The example was on the board, and I
stood with pointer in hand ready for explanation.
Contrary to my expectation,
my voice did not tremble; and when I
finished, I was prouder than I have ever
been since.</p>

<p>Then followed algebra, as far as we
had gone.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is well done,&#8221; said Mr. Wentworth
with a pleasant smile. &#8220;Such examples
make boys think; and when once they
begin to think, then they begin to learn
in reality. Perhaps you sometimes wonder
why such and such examples were put
into the algebra; you can see no use in
them, except to puzzle you. I will tell<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">[125]</span>
you. It is to make you deep, earnest
thinkers. Boys that can think about their
sums, solve their problems, and explain
them readily, can also think about something
else. That is why you study algebra,
and that is why you are drilled so
thoroughly in Latin and Greek. It is to
make you think patiently, and so learn
to overcome difficulties. Learn to think
then, and never give up because you do
not understand what practical use it is
to be to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>And as this was the last lesson on the
programme, he took occasion to tell us
the grand incentive to all this labor was
because God had given us minds of untold
worth; that these minds were to live
for ever, and the more we acquired, so
much the more should we be able to understand
the works of the Creator, so
much better should we be able to discharge
the duties incumbent upon us, so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">[126]</span>
much better able to work for Him who
has given us these minds, who has so
liberally endowed us with all these wonderful
attributes of the soul. And he
urged us all to remember our Creator in
the days of our youth, to give our hearts
to him when young, that we might be led
and guarded by him along life&#8217;s pathway.</p>

<p>This made me think of Mr. Kirby.
&#8220;Do good men all talk alike?&#8221; asked
Jennie, as soon as the bell struck for
recess.</p>

<p>After dinner, which we took with Mr.
and Mrs. Harlan, we were again marched
into the school-room, and examined
closely in Latin. As beginners we came
first, and I was surprised that we received
so much praise, expecting as a matter
of course that this would only be awarded
the advanced classes; but Mr. Wentworth
said,</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">[127]</span>&#8220;The foundation is the chief thing.
Once well grounded in the rudiments,
and the rest is sure. Here is where the
work is to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>At night Dr. Graham shook hands
with us kindly, and said that he thought
our village was well represented. Frank
Clavers had been sick for a few weeks,
and obliged to stay at home. Still, his
class had well sustained themselves, and
Frank had always been at the head. Mr.
Farnham and Mr. Wentworth were particularly
kind, and Jennie could hardly
contain herself as we rode home.</p>

<p>&#8220;It was better a great deal than the
boy in the book; he broke down several
times, and you did not fail once,&#8221; and
she slid her mittened hand into mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fail! I guess he didn&#8217;t,&#8221; cried Mr.
Willett. &#8220;Why, he came out the best
there. It was no bad thing his being
with me last summer; nothing like practice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">[128]</span>
for a boy;&#8221; and Mr. Willett enjoyed
with evident satisfaction the idea that
whatever knowledge I had of mathematics
was based on the practice I had in his
grocery.</p>

<p>It had not been specified how long I was
to remain at Rockdale. &#8220;Till spring,&#8221;
Miss Grimshaw said; but whether that
meant April or May was to me uncertain.
What was my surprise, however, when
May came and I asked if I was not to
stop, and she answered, &#8220;The term is so
nearly out it would be a pity for you to
leave. I have spoken to Mr. Harlan
about it, and he wishes you to remain;
you must work hard enough in vacation
to make up for it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The term closed in June, and then
there was a final examination of a week.
Frank Clavers was again with us, and as
usual at the head of his class.</p>
<hr class="chap x-ebookmaker-drop" />

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">[129]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">VII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> the mass of school-boys, vacation is
hailed not only as a respite from study,
but also as a time to indulge in that
&#8220;dolce far niente&#8221; life<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[A]</a> so refreshing after
months of prolonged effort. Not so in my
case. I must not take advantage of Miss
Grimshaw&#8217;s kindness, nor encroach too
far on the benevolence of Mrs. Jeffries.
Through their goodness I had been enabled
to finish the term, and now I must
work as faithfully as I had studied.</p>

<p>As there was little to do in the grocery
and Mr. Willett already had a boy, I
thought best to try the farmers. True, I
knew little of haying or harvesting; but I
was strong, and willing to do my best.</p>

<p>The next day after school closed I set<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">[130]</span>
out to find employment. Mr. Cosgrove at
the Corners was the first one to whom I
applied.</p>

<p>&#8220;No; you have been to school for the
year; of course that has spoiled you for
labor.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But mine has not been an easy life,
Mr. Cosgrove. I walked three miles to the
academy and back every day. I can
work just as well, for all that?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, indeed; books spoil every one
for work. There never was a better boy
than Farley Steadman, till he took it into
his head to go to college; and now I
would not let him drive a cart through a
pair of bars. He don&#8217;t know any thing;
it has just spoiled him;&#8221; and the old man
drove the nail into the fence he was
strengthening, with more force than
usual.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you know of any one, Mr. Cosgrove,
likely to want help?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">[131]</span>&#8220;Why, yes, every one wants help if
he can get it; I do, but I don&#8217;t want
school-boys.&#8221;</p>

<p>I walked away not a little disconcerted.
To get work would, I thought, be an
easy matter. I had never for one moment
supposed my going to school would
be the least drawback. The next place
was Mr. Colton&#8217;s; he had just engaged
all the help he would need for the summer.
&#8220;Farmer White on the hill might
hire you,&#8221; he said; so I trudged off to
farmer White&#8217;s. &#8220;No, I have rented my
farm, and keep no one myself.&#8221;</p>

<p>What to do I hardly knew; I had
walked all the morning, and was tired.
Besides, I did not know of any one else
that would be likely to want extra help
for the summer.</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s Mr. Wyman at the Cross,&#8221;
said farmer White; &#8220;I shouldn&#8217;t wonder
if he might want you. You can try<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">[132]</span>
him; he is a mighty fine man, and his
wife is a good Christian woman.&#8221;</p>

<p>I started for Mr. Wyman&#8217;s. It was
five miles from Mr. White&#8217;s, and the hot
June sun was pouring down his strongest
beams. I walked fast, but I could not
help thinking; and almost before I was
aware, I seemed to feel the visible presence
of Mr. Kirby, to hear again the
prayer he made in the mountain temple.
I remembered too that he had told me
how much distressed he was when the
doctor first told him to go into the mountains.
He had laid out his summer&#8217;s
work, and was not willing to leave it.
Days passed; he grew worse, and again
his physician advised him to spend a few
weeks among the hills. &#8220;I called it so
much waste time,&#8221; he said&mdash;&#8220;time in
which I could do nothing for myself, or
for others. Yet it has not proved so.&#8221;</p>

<p>No, I knew it had not, for it was his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">[133]</span>
constant aim to serve his heavenly Father,
and if he had for a time left his
work in one place, still he labored for
souls wherever he was; consequently his
daily life among the hills blossomed into
sweet charities which would ripen into
sweeter fruit.</p>

<p>What did I not owe him? Jennie too
had remembered his words, and studied
the little Bible he gave her, first because
he had given it, and afterwards because
its teachings responded to her spirit&#8217;s
need. It is hardly possible for one to be
a constant reader of that blessed book
without a marked effect on heart and life.
The diligent student of the Bible will
have his tastes refined, his affections
made more pure, his aspirations elevated,
and his whole moral and mental tone
immeasurably exalted. I could see this
in Jennie, and I trusted there was something
of the like in my own case. But<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">[134]</span>
as yet I knew nothing of the pardoning
love of the Redeemer.</p>

<p>I gained the brow of the hill from which
I could see Mr. Wyman&#8217;s house, and look
down on the rich field of grain waving in
the sunlight. Every thing had a fresh,
tidy appearance, and spoke of good management
on the part of Mr. Wyman.
Looking along the road, I saw a boy of
my own size coming leisurely along; and
as he approached I saw it was Ezra Metcalf,
a lad that I had seen in Claverton.</p>

<p>&#8220;A long time since I have seen you,
Ezra,&#8221; I said as he came up. &#8220;Are you
going to the village?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes; I can&#8217;t stand it any longer.
Old Wyman is so cross there&#8217;s no doing
any thing with him. It is work, work,
work; and when I would think it was all
done, he&#8217;d send me into the house to
wait on his wife.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Men hire boys to work,&#8221; I answered.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">[135]</span>&#8220;Yes; but all the time is a little too
much. Rain or shine, it made no difference.
It seemed to be all that he thought
of, to get as much work out of me as he
could.&#8221;</p>

<p>I listened to his statement without any
misgiving, and when he had finished, I
told him of my purpose to ask Mr. Wyman
for work.</p>

<p>&#8220;You had better not, if you want
any flesh left on your bones,&#8221; he answered.</p>

<p>I bade him good-by, and we walked
on, each his own way.</p>

<p>I found Mr. Wyman in his field hoeing
corn. He did not stop as I came up
and made known my errand.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I want a smart, go-ahead kind
of boy; one who knows how work should
be done, and will do it faithfully, whether
I am by or not, if I could only find
one of that sort.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">[136]</span>&#8220;Will you try me, Mr. Wyman?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you ever worked on a farm?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, sir; but I am willing to work,
and I think I could do whatever there is
to be done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What have you been doing for the
last year?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have studied at the Rockdale
academy.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What is your name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marston Howe.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Marston Howe! I have heard Mr.
Farnham speak of you as a good scholar.
If you work as you study, I will take
you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall aim to do so, Mr. Wyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Let me see you hoe;&#8221; and he rested
a moment.</p>

<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, thrust your hoe deep;
in that way you cut off the roots, and
they will not be apt to sprout again;
while if you hoe lightly, you only clip<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">[137]</span>
off the tops, and after the first rain they
will be quite as bad as they are now.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was new work to me. I went to
bed at night tired as I never was before
in my life; and but for the remembrance
of Mr. Kirby, I doubt if I should have
had courage to commence anew in the
morning. But life is something more
than sleeping and eating. It is the maturing
into noble deeds, the consciousness
of mental power, the exercise of
that power in heroic self-conquest, and
in doing good to others. I thought of
this as I arose and looked up to the
mountain we had once climbed. There
it stood clearly defined against the calm,
pure sky, its sides radiant with golden
light that had not yet reached the valley.
The noble manhood that Mr. Kirby exemplified
must be sought with tireless
footsteps and self-sacrificing heart.</p>

<p>The farmer was out as I came down.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">[138]</span>&#8220;So you did not oversleep yourself,&#8221;
said he as he bade me good-morning.</p>

<p>&#8220;I did not rise as early as usual this
morning, Mr. Wyman; hoeing is new
business. I shall get accustomed to it,
and can sleep just as well after it as after
any thing else, I suppose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is hard work, and so is every thing
else. Some people make play out of it,
but that is not my way. I was brought
up to think that any thing that was worth
doing at all, was worth doing well.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no lack of work at Mr.
Wyman&#8217;s, neither was it always the same
thing. Sometimes I felt like murmuring
when, after a hard day&#8217;s work in the
field, I was obliged to take the horses to
the blacksmith&#8217;s, or carry corn to the
mill, mend fences, or do something else
of like nature. Mr. Wyman did not
hold to sitting still. There were no idle
moments, all were filled up; and when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">[139]</span>
night came, I was so tired that I fell
asleep without so much as a verse in my
Bible.</p>

<p>Then haying came on; and while the
hands swung their scythes with an easy
grace that I tried in vain to imitate, it
fell to my part to do the raking. There
was something so sweet and fragrant
about the new-mown hay, that I enjoyed
haying much better than hoeing.</p>

<p>Once Jennie came to see me in the
hay-field, and her dimpled face lit up
with excess of joy as she tossed the clover
and chased the butterflies, her heart
full of sweet-springing thoughts. Resting
a few moments on the hay, with her
glad blue eyes looking up into the sky,
she said a few hearty words about God&#8217;s
love in opening up a path to us. Young
as she was, she was beginning to feel the
sweet influence of his Spirit in her heart,
inciting her to love and serve him, believing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">[140]</span>
that his promises were sure, and
that he would never leave nor forsake her.</p>

<p>Sweet little comforter; she hardly
knew from what her words often saved
me, desponding as I not unfrequently
was, and inclined to go back instead of
forward, feeling tempted to half do my
work, and never dream of any thing
more than present comfort.</p>

<p>Coming to me in my need, repeating
the words Mr. Kirby had spoken, going
over with her Sabbath-school hymns and
texts, she reminded me more and more
of our sainted mother, and stimulated me
more than words can tell to make use of
every means in my power to get good
and do good. Thus my evil thoughts
did not gain the ascendency; and by continual
striving I grew to enjoy my labor
as my study, doing both with a will and
determination to succeed.</p>

<p>Every Saturday I walked five miles,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">[141]</span>
for the purpose of hearing Jennie&#8217;s weekly
lesson and walking to church with her
on the Sabbath.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not forget the Sabbath,&#8221; had
been one of the last injunctions of my
dear mother; and when tempted, as I
often was, to stay from church or from
Sabbath-school because I was tired, or
my dress was old and patched, or to read
and study since I had so little time in the
week, the thought of transgressing against
her wish, rather than because it was a
positive command of God, has often led
me to his house, trying to cultivate a
proper spirit on his holy day. And now
that I have learned more of his law and
of the wonderful plan of redemption for
a guilty world, I bless his great name
that I was early inclined to keep his Sabbath.
Let me ask any little boy or girl
who is trying to be a climber, to remember
the Sabbath; not to think idle,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">[142]</span>
foolish, wicked thoughts, neither to make
companions of those who are accustomed
to doing this; but reading God&#8217;s word,
thinking of his love, listening to his servants,
and praying for the indwelling of
his Spirit.</p>

<p>The Sabbath before the fall term of
the academy was to commence, Mr. Harlan
preached at Claverton. His text
was, &#8220;The entrance of thy word giveth
light; it giveth understanding unto the
simple.&#8221; He spoke of light as the great
vivifier, the life-giving principle, the
beautifier. It paints the leaf of the lily
and the rose, veins the violet, and tinges
the varied landscape with beauty. Without
sunlight the visual scope would be
limited, and the beautiful around us
would fail to awaken our interest.</p>

<p>Before the Creator uttered that great
fiat, &#8220;Let there be light,&#8221; darkness was
upon the face of the great deep; all matter<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">[143]</span>
was in a circumfused mass, no ray of
light to penetrate the gloom; and when
there was light, it presented the earth
without form and void. But when the
sun was set in the firmament of heaven,
then the earth brought forth grass, herbs,
trees, and flowers; even the angels were
charmed with its beauty, and the morning
stars sang together for joy.</p>

<p>So without the Lord Jesus Christ, who
is the great light of the moral firmament,
all the light man has can only present a
world without form, void of all beauty
and all good; and it is only so far as &#8220;the
Day-spring from on high has visited us,
to give light to them that sit in darkness
and in the shadow of death,&#8221; that the
moral earth begins to shoot forth the
choicest plants and to produce the richest
fruits, so that the sons of God shout
for joy and heaven rings with anthems
of praise.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">[144]</span>The Scriptures set forth the birth of
Christ under the figure of the rising sun.
How glorious is this figure! When the
heart drinks in the beauty of his words,
when the light of his countenance shines
upon the repentant soul, what a flood of
rapture thrills the entire being! Christ
is to us what the sun is to the material
world, the dispenser of light, life, and
joy.</p>

<p>We have seen vegetables growing in
corners or cellars, pale and delicate,
creeping feebly towards a ray of light
that penetrated some small crevice, like
beings in distress stretching out their
hands for help. Like those delicate and
sickly plants, watching eagerly every
ray of light, feeling their way through
the darkness, hoping to find some opening
that would lead out into a world of
beauty, is often the experience of the
individual Christian. Religion is not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">[145]</span>
thing of gloom and clouds. It is a lamp,
a light, a sun; the very thing to cheer a
desolate heart, and to brighten still more
a cheerful, happy spirit.</p>

<p>&#8220;That was what made Mr. Kirby so
good and happy, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221; said Jennie
as we went home.</p>

<p>&#8220;And Mr. Brisbane,&#8221; I continued. &#8220;I
often wondered how he could be so happy
when he was always suffering.&#8221;</p>

<p>It had always been a habit since we
had been with Miss Grimshaw to repeat
as much of the sermon as we could to
grandma, as we called Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s
mother. This morning the sermon was
easy to remember; and when we finished
the poor woman took off her spectacles,
and wiped the tears from her
wrinkled face. She was one of God&#8217;s
chosen ones; but her life had been darkened
with much sorrow. Of eight children,
she had buried all but one. Still<span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">[146]</span>
was she uniformly cheerful and happy.
A simple untaught woman, her understanding
had been developed by the reading
of His word, and his precious promises
were familiar utterances in her humble
home.</p>

<p>Monday morning I rose early; the dew-drops
sparkling on the grass, and the
birds filling the trees with music. Jennie
walked through the village and beyond
the mill with me. Stopping to say good-by,
we heard a noise of distress, and a
fluttering of wings in a thicket near the
roadside.</p>

<p>Jennie was attracted at once, her loving
heart responsive to the agony of the
fluttering birds. On careful inspection,
we found two little birdlings on the
ground. They had fallen out of their
nest, and though able to hop a little, could
not fly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Come, brother, put them back again,&#8221;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">[147]</span>
and she held the little panting things,
while I parted the leaves and found the
nest, standing on tiptoe to put them in,
and then retreating a little distance to
see what the old ones would do.</p>

<p>&#8220;Fallen out of their nest, just like us,
brother; but God will take care of us.
He has, and he will;&#8221; and she flung her
arms round my neck and kissed me
good-by, and I ran on as fast as I could.</p>

<p>&#8220;Like birds fallen out of our nest.&#8221;
I thought of it till I reached Mr. Wyman&#8217;s.
I had lost a little time, for Jennie
could not walk as fast as I could.
Breakfast was nearly over; but Mr. Wyman
was not cross, and Mrs. Wyman
gave me a cup of coffee, and a plate filled
with what she had set away for me,
and for which my early walk had given
me a keen relish.</p>

<p>The haying was over; but there was
grain to cut, and I took my sickle for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">[148]</span>
first time. All day my heart was light
and cheerful; I felt the influence of the
Sabbath rest, and I seemed continually
to hear Mr. Harlan&#8217;s text, &#8220;The entrance
of thy word giveth light; it giveth understanding
to the simple.&#8221; I resolved that
I would study my Bible; it should be to
me a daily friend and companion. Mr.
Kirby&#8217;s words too went ringing through
my brain: &#8220;Do what you do well, and
God will open a path where He sees that
you can do something better.&#8221; Then
Jennie and the birds came up again;
and thus with a continued succession of
pleasant thoughts, the day went happily
away.</p>

<p>Mr. Wyman was kind, and more jovial
than usual; and after the evening meal,
when I had filled the buckets with water,
and helped Mrs. Wyman in the dairy, I
drew up my chair to the table and commenced
reading the weekly paper. Presently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">[149]</span>
Mr. Wyman left his seat on the
porch, knocked the ashes from his pipe,
laid it on the mantel, and said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Wife, have you told Marston what
Mr. Farnham said?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have not had time; you had best
tell him, papa.&#8221;</p>

<p>I looked up in surprise. What had I
done now? Was it because I was a few
minutes behind time in the morning?
There was no room for conjecture. Taking
the arm-chair, Mr. Wyman began:</p>

<p>&#8220;Have you any plans for the fall and
winter, Marston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I was hoping that you would need
me for the fall, Mr. Wyman; and in the
winter I should like to go to school,&#8221; I
answered with a choking voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Farnham was here Saturday
night, after you went to Claverton. He
spoke of you, and said that you was trying
to study, and hoped to go through<span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">[150]</span>
college. Do you really think of any
thing like this?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If I can, Mr. Wyman, although I am
sometimes afraid it will take a long time.
I can only hope to go to school winters,
at least for several years.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what Mr. Farnham said,
and as we no longer have a boy to educate,
he made me more than half believe
that I ought to help you. He said that
you could nearly pay your board with
errands, and odd jobs for Mr. Harlan;
and I told him I would pay you wages
through this month and the next. So if
you want to go to school, you had better
begin Wednesday. The more one knows,
the better they may get along. Learn
all you can, and try and make a man.
Boys sometimes think their employers
have no hearts. There has not been a
day since you came here, in which I have
not remembered my Willie, and felt for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">[151]</span>
you. I could have made your work
easier, but that would not be the way to
make you a prompt, useful, industrious
man.&#8221;</p>

<p>My head bowed low while he spoke.
I wished that I could live over the past
months. I had tried; but there had been
many days when I had dragged on, working
because obliged to, yet not cheerful
and happy. So many resolves I had
made and broken; so many times felt
like running away, and hiding myself out
of sight and sound, longing to be free
from responsibility and from effort, and
then in a moment ashamed to think I
should so forget, should be so weak and
vacillating. Could I only live the vacation
over again, I would be more watchful,
more patient in trial.</p>

<p>It is thus we ever feel, when we look
back. Yet do we always gain wisdom
from the retrospect? The future instead<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">[152]</span>
of the past calls for our resolves, and the
wail of memory blending with the whispers
of conscience, should be our incentive
to a more useful life.</p>

<p>But when Mrs. Wyman came in with
some nice new shirts that were once
Willie&#8217;s, and a handsome blue cloth
jacket, that &#8220;looked so like the dear
boy,&#8221; she said, I broke down entirely.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not deserve all this,&#8221; I said,
choking down the tears. She put her
hand on mine.</p>

<p>&#8220;We give you these, Marston, to show
that we approve your effort. Mr. Farnham
told us how you went to school last
year. There were no obstacles you did
not overcome. A long walk twice a day,
with bitter, stinging cold, and still you
made no excuse. You have worked
faithfully during vacation, and Mr. Wyman
will let your wages run through the
next month. But you cannot go to school<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">[153]</span>
without clothes; we have no one to wear
them now;&#8221; and tears were on both of our
faces. &#8220;Here&#8217;s a cap, and boots too, that
were Willie&#8217;s. I shall be glad to see you
wear them. Willie loved books. He
would have gone to college, had he lived.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could not answer; it was all so sudden,
so unexpected. I could look back
and see so many places where I had failed.
With a full heart I hurried up to
my room, thankful that I was to go to
school, that a path had opened; and resolving
anew that each moment should
be spent to the best advantage.</p>

<p>How it would gladden Jennie&#8217;s heart.
&#8220;One step at a time,&#8221; she had whispered
to me so often; &#8220;Mr. Kirby said that
was enough for you to plan now. All
that you are required to do is the work
of the present hour, and then forward to
the next. You will do it yet, Marston,
I know you will.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">[154]</span>Borne up on the encouragement of her
words, I felt that I should. It would
take years; but others had gone over the
ground, and I could do the same; and
with the thought of Mr. Kirby and Jennie,
I fell asleep.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">VIII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was said by a celebrated divine,
&#8220;What we wish to be, that we become.&#8221;
And perhaps it is so; for when our Creator
allows a great longing to fill the
soul, in the wish itself lies the surest
pledge of its future realization. It was
thus with me in reference to going to
school. In addition to what Mrs. Wyman
had given me, Miss Grimshaw had
provided me an outfit, for it seemed she
had an inkling that I was to return in
September.</p>

<p>I spent one night with Jennie, and
Wednesday found me at Rockdale. Mr.
Wyman had taken me over in his buggy:
he had business at Terryville, he said,
and would like to call at the academy; he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">[156]</span>
used to know Mr. Harlan. Taking a kind
leave after a short call, he said,</p>

<p>&#8220;When your money gives out, don&#8217;t
be afraid to call on me. You can pay
me when you get through, if you like.
If not, it will only be a trifle of what I
should have done for Willie.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was the man whom I had often
called cold and unfeeling since that morning
on which I met Ezra Metcalf going
back to the village: no sympathy for a
young heart in its struggles, no encouragement
to give one trying to do right.
How my heart smote me now, as I stood
and watched him till he was out of sight;
and then I tried to concentrate all my
thoughts on my lesson.</p>

<p>The first day of the term is always a
broken one. Lessons are laid out, but
not expected to be studied; new scholars
coming in, and old ones to greet.
Frank Clavers and Robert Lovell were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">[157]</span>
delighted to have me back again, and
Robert drew me into the same old seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that,&#8221; said Mr. Harlan laughing.
&#8220;I look to you for assistance as well as
study. Pupils that I know I allow to sit
back; the seats near the desk are for
new-comers;&#8221; and together we went
down the aisle to the back seat.</p>

<p>Robert Lovell did not board in the
academy. He was the only son of a
widowed mother, who lived in Terryville,
and he paid his tuition by teaching a
class of the smallest boys. Hence he was
looked upon as both teacher and pupil;
and his good sense and judicious bearing
won the entire regard of those with
whom he had to do. Of Scotch descent,
large and overgrown, he looked much
older than he really was. As a scholar,
he was deep rather than brilliant, with
a powerful memory, and fine appreciation
of the beautiful. He was studying<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">[158]</span>
for the ministry, and his heart was alive
to the importance of the work; but why
he gave me such marked demonstrations
of his friendship, I never knew; while for
him I soon felt a warmth of regard second
only to that given Mr. Kirby. Further
advanced in his studies, he was of
great assistance to me in my lessons&mdash;not
by helping with translations, solving
problems, etc., but telling me circumstances
connected with the time he was
studying such and such a book, what he
was obliged to do, his walks to school,
and the efforts he had to make; giving
me to see how small was my labor in
comparison with his, my self-denial nothing
like that he had known. Then drawing
his chair nearer, and taking my hand,
he would tell me the sweet story of the
cross, painting in such colors the matchless
purity and beauty of a life it was
ours to imitate, that I forgot myself and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">[159]</span>
my books, and only saw the bleeding,
dying Saviour; only heard the sweet accents
of his love, &#8220;Come unto me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I shall never forget the first Sabbath
at Rockdale. It did not seem that I
could be denied spending the day with
Jennie, and still Mr. Harlan had specified
that I was to remain there. Try as
I would, I rebelled not a little. Robert
Lovell came into my room, and seeing
my sorrowful face, asked the cause. I
told him of my little sister, my mother&#8217;s
charge concerning her, and that I could
not be happy if obliged to remain from
her over the Sabbath.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is a great self-denial, I can see;
but if you have the right spirit, you do
not need to go to Claverton to spend Sunday
properly. God looks at the heart;
he sees all your love and devotion, and
he is not one to forget. You want an education;
through the kindness of friends,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">[160]</span>
you are put in a position to help yourself.
This involves your being here at
your post all the time, and Saturday is
of course your busiest day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, and I feel quite ashamed
of being so gloomy about it; but Jennie
will miss me at Sabbath-school.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That is just what I came in for. I
want you to spend the Sabbath with me.
Mr. Farnham has given me a class of
boys about your age, and I should like
to have you with us. We study together.
I do not know so much more than they
do, but I am willing to do what I can,
and we shall improve in proportion as
we become interested in that blessed
book.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So am I willing to do any thing,&#8221; I
answered. &#8220;I am sorry I have been so
fretful this morning. As you say, if I
have the right spirit, I can spend the
Sabbath here as well as in Claverton. I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">[161]</span>
can think of Jennie as she sits in her little
room; and when we do meet, we can
compare our lessons and note our advancement
just as we do in our other
studies.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly; and remember that God
knows us, and approves not so much
what we have accomplished, as the effort
that we make. It is not what we give
that makes our offering acceptable, but
the spirit in which it is given; not what
we do, but the spirit in which it is done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I wish it was not such an effort to be
good. I do try.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so to every one, Marston; you
are no exception. The more you read
and study the Bible, the more you will
learn that life is a continued warfare.
Good and great as St. Paul was, he felt
this more keenly than you do. The natural
heart is deceitful, depraved, and
desperately wicked; and even when renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">[162]</span>
by divine grace, still constant
watch and care are needed lest we fall
into temptation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Who then can be good?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;All those who lean upon the Saviour.
But so soon as we aim to walk by
ourselves, we are lost. You must do
this, Marston;&#8221; and Robert Lovell slid
his arm around me, and in the silence of
my own room, prayed with me as Mr.
Kirby had done, that I might become an
earnest follower of Christ; that I might
be willing to be taught of him; and that
now, in the morning of life, I might dedicate
both heart and life to his service.</p>

<p>&#8220;This is what I want to do,&#8221; I said as
we rose from our knees; &#8220;but when I
try hardest, my thoughts will fly off to
something else, or hasty, impetuous feelings
will rush over me, and make me feel
there is no use in trying. Oh Robert,
you don&#8217;t know what a wicked boy I am.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">[163]</span>&#8220;There is no good in ourselves, Marston.
It is all of His mercy. Go to the
Saviour just as you are, and ask his assistance,
his Spirit. He knows all your
temptations, all your weaknesses, and he
also knows all your efforts. Love and
trust him, and his Spirit will help you to
overcome. You will try to do this? say
that you will;&#8221; and he held me firmly by
the hand.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will, Robert; I will.&#8221;</p>

<p>Rockdale was less than half a mile
from Terryville. It had been Mr. Harlan&#8217;s
custom to have his pupils go to Mr.
Farnham&#8217;s church, leaving him free to
preach in the neighborhood adjacent. In
this way many were favored with the
preached word that would otherwise have
been deprived of it; and it is to be hoped
much good was done by thus scattering
the seed in out-of-the-way places.</p>

<p>But while Mr. Harlan was doing all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">[164]</span>
the good he could, and Robert Lovell
was not unmindful of the work before
him, active in the double position of both
teacher and pupil, there were at Rockdale
other spirits quite as energetic in
another direction&mdash;boys that seemed to
have no idea of any thing beyond physical
enjoyment, to elude the teachers,
escape study, and &#8220;have a good time.&#8221;
This was the great end and aim of their
school life.</p>

<p>As Robert Lovell&#8217;s home was at the
extreme part of the village, I did not see
as much of him as of some of the others;
and no doubt he thought me weak and
vacillating, contrasting as I sometimes
did the industrious, painstaking pupil
with the selfish, ease-loving one, who
seemed to get along just as well. Happy,
cheerful, fun-loving spirits, with plenty
of money to spend, and always ready for
a forage on watermelons or into the cakes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">[165]</span>
and pies in Mrs. Harlan&#8217;s pantry. Their
only concern was, not to be discovered.
Like the Spartan, they held it was no
harm to steal; the only disgrace was in
being discovered; every other consideration
was too trivial for a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such boys will not make men,&#8221; said
Robert Lovell. &#8220;Look in your &#8216;Self
Helps&#8217;&mdash;you will find no such examples.&#8221;</p>

<p>After a while I had an opportunity to
go home, as I continued to call Miss
Grimshaw&#8217;s, more perhaps because Jennie
lived there than any thing else. All
the weeks that I had been at school, Jennie
had been studying; and that evening
she had much to tell me of her lessons,
many questions to ask, and explanations
to go over. She had taken up philosophy
and natural science; and her quick
understanding seemed to grasp easily<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">[166]</span>
what it had taken me a long time to
learn.</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one exercise that you have,&#8221;
she said at tea, &#8220;that I should like very
much, and that is composition.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Composition!&#8221; and I laughed heartily;
for the week before I had listened
to a knot of girls as they spoke particularly
of their dislike of this exercise
above all others.</p>

<p>&#8220;If you desire to write compositions,&#8221;
I replied, trying to look grave, &#8220;I do not
see why you may not write them here.
I have to write them, and I try to do my
best. I can&#8217;t say how little I might do
if I was not obliged to do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but how am I to know if they
are correctly written?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can see that they are spelled
rightly, written and folded neatly. Put
your thought into the very best language
you have. The second time it will be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">[167]</span>
easier than the first, and so on. Write
just as you would talk, easy, naturally,
and without effort. These are the rules
Mr. Harlan gave me. I will find some
one to correct them for you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Besides composition, Jennie had to tell
me about her pupil, for young as she was
she had turned teacher.</p>

<p>&#8220;He is a big boy, nearly as large as
you are, Marston; but I felt so sorry for
him. He said his father and mother
were both dead, and he had no one to
care for him, no one to mind whether
he was bad or good; that he did try to
work, and Mr. Wyman turned him away:
he forgot one night to put up the bars,
and the cows got into the corn. He was
sorry, and would not have neglected it
again; yet Mr. Wyman would not believe
him, but told him he had nothing more
for him to do. I couldn&#8217;t help telling
him that if he would come in every evening<span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">[168]</span>
I would teach him arithmetic; and
sure enough, he has been in regularly,
and is studying in good earnest.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pray what is your pupil&#8217;s name?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Ezra Metcalf. Oh, brother, you know
he is a big boy; but he has never had anybody
to tell him how to be good. He
goes to Sabbath-school too;&#8221; and she
looked eagerly for my approval.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has improved a great deal,&#8221; said
grandma; &#8220;he hardly looks like the same
boy; as trim and neat as anybody now:
he has found a place to live and work,
and goes to church regularly. I never
saw such a change in any one. I shouldn&#8217;t
wonder if he made somebody right smart
yet; if he does, you&#8217;ll have the credit of
it, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not think there is any credit in
it, grandma. What should I have known,
had there been no one to tell me? Marston
and I have much to be thankful for.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">[169]</span>
I often think of Mr. Kirby, and how much
he told me. Ezra Metcalf never had a
friend like that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You are right, Jennie,&#8221; said grandma
with a little pat of her hand; &#8220;I am
glad to see that you are willing to share
with others the good that you have yourself
received. This is as it should be.&#8221;</p>

<p>Thus Jennie was finding her work,
and I was stimulated anew as we talked
over all that Mr. Kirby had taught us.</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could only have such a person
with us all the time,&#8221; said Jennie. &#8220;And
still my Sabbath-school teacher says that
we can all have a Friend better and wiser
than any earthly friend can be. All that
is necessary is to ask him; the precious
Saviour is always ready to be a friend
to any who heartily desire him. You
do, don&#8217;t you, Marston?&#8221; and she laid
her little head on my shoulder; &#8220;and I
do. Mr. Kirby could not stay with us,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">[170]</span>
neither can we be together; we both
want just such a Friend;&#8221; and the blue
eyes looked up to mine pleadingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Jennie, I mean to ask Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We will both ask Him. Miss Ackers
says he never turns any away, especially
if they are poor. I told Ezra Metcalf of
this, and he promised to seek the Saviour.&#8221;</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> gorgeous autumn days had gone,
and the snow was beginning to whiten
the mountains, when Robert Lovell left
Rockdale to teach in a neighboring district
during the winter months. Very
lonely it seemed without him; for with
the exception of Mr. and Mrs. Harlan,
there was no one else that felt half the
interest in me, and as a natural consequence,
of whom I thought half as much.
I should miss him, but then my duties
would not allow of many regretful moments.
Snow, ice, and cold weather
would only add to my work; and I tried
hard to look it in the face, and to be cheerful
and happy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Homesick without Lovell!&#8221; said my
room-mate, one of the best-natured, most<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">[172]</span>
amiable, and still most indolent scholars
in school. &#8220;Such an old sanctimonious
thing; he never entered into any of our
fun, neither would he let you. I tell you
what, Marston, you&#8217;ve been shut up long
enough. We have some capital times
that the old folks know nothing about.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Is that right, Farden?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right!&#8217; that&#8217;s Lovell all over,&#8221; and
he laughed till the room fairly echoed.
&#8220;&#8216;Right&#8217; who ever heard such a question
but from some white-livered thing
like Lovell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Farden, you shall not speak of Lovell
in that manner. Cowardice has no
part in his character; you know as well
as I do there is not a braver scholar in
the school;&#8221; and I bounded across the
room, startled out of my usual quiet by
the unjust accusation.</p>

<p>&#8220;Really, Howe, you show anger just
as soon as any of us, in spite of all your<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">[173]</span>
goodness. A thousand pities Lovell is
not here to see you in such a towering
passion. That&#8217;s just what I like, though.
I only said it to see if you could be
worked up.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You knew it was untrue, and yet
said it to stir me up. Richard Farden,
I had not thought you could do any thing
so base as that; for the future I shall
understand you better;&#8221; and I turned on
my heel and went back to my book.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know he&#8217;s as brave as a lion.
Come, Howe, it was foolish; I did not
mean to anger you; I am sorry. Come,
make up with me. I see Lovell has not
spoiled you; only say that you will be
one with us.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will not be one with you,&#8221; and I
opened my Virgil.</p>

<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the use of studying your
eyes out, Howe? it will do you no good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Good or not, I shall study,&#8221; I answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">[174]</span>
vexed at myself for being so
hasty; &#8220;I came here to study.&#8221; I thought
of Jennie&#8217;s pale face, and earnest eyes;
she was now studying, and I could not
but acknowledge to myself that she would
feel sorry did she know how easily I had
been disturbed. How was it that my
good resolves were so easily shaken?
Why was I so moved by the word and
look of another? Could I only have looked
with an unwavering trust to Him who
was both able and willing to be to me
the friend I so much needed.</p>

<p>And still I thought I loved and trusted
him. But Oh, it was only a half
trust. I did not lean implicitly on him;
I still felt that I could do something to
merit his favor; that something was expected
and required of me, and I must
do it.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus182.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>And here let me urge all in the long
list of climbers, to examine well and see<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">[175]</span>
if self does not intrude: if they are in
truth willing to be guided and led by
Christ; willing to walk in the path appointed,
not idly, not passively, not
sleepily, but with energy, doing all that
can be done, always doing their best.
Never giving way, going back, desponding,
or denying Christ. Or, if they have
denied him, like Peter repenting bitterly,
and resolving as he did to be more
energetic, more fearless, more faithful in
the future.</p>

<p>The room was so still I thought Farden
had gone out; but soon there was a blue
line of smoke curling and twisting upward,
and the subtle perfume of the &#8220;fragrant
weed&#8221; was plainly perceptible. A
little sigh, and Farden poised his cigar
in true professional style, tipped back his
chair, planted both feet on the mantel,
and spoke again.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here to study. There was no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">[176]</span>
end to the plans I laid. I was to study
every day and every night, and in a short
time I expected to learn all that was to
be taught here; then to college, and had
little doubt but I should speedily distance
the professors, and perhaps rival
Humboldt himself. Instead of that I
don&#8217;t look into a book once a week, except
when I recite; and I don&#8217;t see but
I get along just as well. If I don&#8217;t know
it, I only have to pick out a difficult word
or phrase, and say that it is not clear to
me, that I do not quite understand it;
and usually it takes so long to explain it
that the time is up. We boys take turns
in this game.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you own to such meanness,&#8221; I
said, as much excited as at first.</p>

<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ve no business to allow themselves
to be deceived.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You neither deceive yourself, nor
any one else. Your tutor understands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">[177]</span>
it, and so does Mr. Harlan; and you know
it is not right.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Right,&#8217; again; of course I do. But I
do not see the use. I shall never talk in
Latin, Greek, or Hebrew; then why delve
so many years over them?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Farnham said it was to make us
think.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Very little good comes of it that I
can see,&#8221; said Farden putting his cigar
to his mouth; &#8220;that problem in equations
that you worked on so long, a precious
little good it will do you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harlan told us the other day
that every obstacle overcome gives us
just so much additional strength; that it
is by these stepping-stones that we attain
the desired result.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Stepping-stones of obstacles! that is
well enough for Mr. Harlan; but I&#8217;ll tell
you what, Howe, money is the stepping-stone
in this country. Give me that,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">[178]</span>
and I don&#8217;t care a picayune for any thing
else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The one that knows most usually
succeeds best; knowledge wins money.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Pshaw! nonsense! that&#8217;s not so.
Why, the richest man in this county can
hardly write his name.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That may be; he may prove an exception;
but that in no wise does away
with the rule.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, my cigar is out. All I can
say is, that we are going to have a capital
time to-night; you had better come
along. You wont tell, any way; Lovell
never did: we could always trust him;&#8221;
and the door closed.</p>

<p>Why was it that I could not study?
Why was it that I should strive and
struggle between my inclination to live
easily, as Farden did, and my desire to
do right? &#8220;No right effort is ever lost,&#8221;
sounded out strong, clear, distinct, almost<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">[179]</span>
as though some one spoke it aloud;
and so forcibly did it take possession of
me, and so much strength sprung up out
of each little word, there was no more
murmuring, and my morning&#8217;s lesson
did not suffer from the ungovernable feeling
of the evening previous.</p>

<p>A few days after the above conversation
Farden came in after his skates,
and Harry Gilmore with him. Tapping
me on the shoulder, Harry said, &#8220;Put
up that book; you are looking like a
scarecrow. Come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221; I asked.</p>

<p>&#8220;First to the ice, and then,&#8221; looking
up archly, &#8220;where we have no stupid
books, but plenty of fun and frolic.
Why not go? What if you do fail in
the next lesson? Some of the boys fail
every day.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will never be thought less of,&#8221;
said Richard Farden. &#8220;I do not look<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">[180]</span>
at my translation till I go in to recite.
It comes to me just as I want to say it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It does not come to me without
study,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is because your brains are so
knotted up poring over it all the while,&#8221;
persisted Harry. &#8220;Clear them out occasionally
with a good jolly spree, and
you&#8217;ll be all right. Come along.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will Mr. Harlan say?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harlan will never know. He
thinks we are all in bed by ten o&#8217;clock.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And so we are,&#8221; said Richard;
&#8220;they don&#8217;t seem to think we can get
up again.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do what you do well&#8221;&mdash;I seemed
to hear Mr. Kirby&#8217;s voice urging me to
do right, while Jennie&#8217;s sweetly pleading
eyes looked reproachingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I will not go,&#8221; I said determinedly.
&#8220;I came here to study, and I will
do it. You know your parents could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">[181]</span>
approve of your course; you know Mr.
Harlan would not; you know your own
conscience does not. I will not go with
you, and I advise you to stay at home
yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Lovell all over; isn&#8217;t it, Harry?&#8221;
and my room-mate examined his skates
carefully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I do wish you would come, Howe;&#8221;
and he spoke half reproachfully.</p>

<p>&#8220;I came here for a purpose, and I
shall follow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>The door closed with a slam. I crossed
the room and leaned my head on the
mantel; school life was so different from
what I had expected. I had supposed
that everybody appreciated study, that
everybody longed for an education, and
that only opportunity was wanted to
make good scholars. I had learned differently.
Nominal students were not
actual learners; neither were those who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">[182]</span>
applied themselves the most diligently,
in all cases the most appreciated. Then
I remembered again Mr. Kirby&#8217;s words:
&#8220;Doing right is the only safe course,
and although slow and wearisome at
first, is sure to succeed. Other paths
may look as if they would lead into
shaded nooks and flowery dells; but ruin
lurks in secret, and despair has a lodge
there. The only safety is in keeping
clear of them, having nothing to do with
them; while the onward road, narrow
and rough though it be, will in the end
lead to the desired result.&#8221;</p>

</div>


<p><span class="smcap">In</span> so large a school as that in Rockdale,
of course there were various cliques,
and each clique with its leader. Frank
Clavers was at the head of the Senior
class, and round him gathered good scholars
and studious boys; while Richard
Farden and Harry Gilmore, by virtue of
wealth, good looks, and an easy, good-natured
manner, took the lead in all
sports and amusements; and Robert Lovell
was looked up to and followed by all
who had a thought of the future. Few
enough there were of these; and to this
clique I had attached myself. Hence
the goodness that my room-mate was
constantly reproaching me with, when I
refused to join in their stolen revels.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sure I should be on the ice half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">[184]</span>
the time, if I could skate as you do,&#8221;
said Harry Gilmore once as I joined the
skaters during recess.</p>

<p>&#8220;So should I perhaps, had I nothing
else to do,&#8221; I answered, skimming over
the smooth surface with all the freedom
of a bird on the wing. &#8220;It is a good
deal of self-denial for me to stay at home,
Harry. I own there are times when an
hour on the ice would please me much
better than sawing wood or making paths
through the snow.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why don&#8217;t you do it then? we have
to beg you ever so long. I had no idea
you could skate so beautifully.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot afford the time,&#8221; I answered
frankly. &#8220;I came here to study; and
you know I nearly pay my board with
what I can do during the hours that you
have for recreation.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And your father don&#8217;t give you a
cent?&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">[185]</span>&#8220;My father and mother are both dead,
Harry. I have the dearest little sister
in the world; but as for money, I earn
all I have with my own hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;This is why you work and study
then,&#8221; said he, linking his arm in mine
and flashing across the pond. &#8220;It makes
me ashamed of myself every time I hear
you refuse to go with Richard; but I
didn&#8217;t know that&mdash;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That I was so poor?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That your parents were dead, and
you trying to educate yourself.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221; shouted Richard Farden
as soon as he turned the bend and
came to shore&mdash;&#8220;how is it that you have
got Howe on his skates? What arguments
have you used, what inducements
held out?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Golden ones, I&#8217;ll be bound,&#8221; shouted
Charles Eaton, while the boys laughed
uproariously.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">[186]</span>&#8220;I have no influence over Marston
Howe,&#8221; said Harry, calling me by my
first name. &#8220;He has an influence over
me, however, and I am resolved each
day more and more to follow it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;How now? what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;
cried several voices as we unstrapped
our skates.</p>

<p>I saw by the look of the sun that my
time was up, and without another word I
hurried up the hill and across the field
to the academy.</p>

<p>Before the study bell rang, Harry Gilmore
came to my room. &#8220;Have you a
moment to spare, Marston?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, a moment for you,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will not call it so much lost
time?&#8221; drawing his chair to the table,
and placing his feet on the fender. &#8220;To
tell the truth, I am ashamed of the life
I am leading this winter; the deception
we practise is outrageous.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">[187]</span>&#8220;You do not deceive any one, Harry.
Mr. Harlan may not know all of your
nightly wanderings; but he knows who
studies and who does not, and so do all
the teachers.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then why don&#8217;t they scold us as we
deserve, send us home, or expel us?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps you would not do any better
at home. They do all they can, both
by precept and example; and they hope
that time and your own good sense will
at length compel you to do better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And I am determined that I will. I
have been led by Richard long enough.
I am resolved to study for the rest of
the term; and if I do, will you be my
friend?&#8221; and he looked at me earnestly.</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget how poor I am. I pay
my board by waiting on the household.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So much the more honor for you. My
father was once a poor man. He&#8217;s rich
now; worth half a million, I suppose.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">[188]</span>
But that only makes me think meaner of
myself. Only think of the money I spend
every week, flinging it away, and you
have none. You say you have a sister;
so have I; and such good letters she
writes me, telling me to use my time
profitably, and not to be led away by
ease-loving, indolent companions. I am
going to try now, and you must help
me.&#8221;</p>

<p>His look and tone touched me, and
my words leaped out, &#8220;As far as I can
I will help you to do right, Harry.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall be a better boy if you will
let me come here sometimes and see you
study. Say that you will, Marston.
There goes the bell. Say that I may
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As often as you like.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If my lessons are good to-morrow,
you may take the credit of it;&#8221; and the
door closed.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">[189]</span>Presently Richard came in, flung down
his cap and gloves, and hastily tore the
envelope from a letter.</p>

<p>&#8220;I declare it&#8217;s too bad; not a cent of
money. Father has no idea of the little
things that draw upon the purse.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It cannot be that you have used the
last he sent,&#8221; I exclaimed, seeing his look
of distress.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, but I have though, and had to
borrow besides. You see every thing is
so high; our suppers have cost enormously;
and now the lectures are coming
on, and I have not a dime.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I have several tickets; that need not
trouble you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The lectures would be dull enough
if it was not for something afterwards:
and the sleigh-rides; I&#8217;ve promised ever
so many I&#8217;d treat them to a ride. It&#8217;s
just the time now; and the old fellow
don&#8217;t seem to appreciate it at all.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">[190]</span>&#8220;He appreciates study more, perhaps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it, Howe, as well as you do.
I don&#8217;t study. I feel ashamed of it, and
still I cannot do better. I mean to in
the spring. I&#8217;ll turn over a new leaf, as
Gilmore says.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Why not begin now?&#8221; I ventured to
ask.</p>

<p>&#8220;Because I can&#8217;t; I&#8217;ve got out of the
way of study, and to go back is not so
readily done. I would not have father
know how I spend my time; and my sister
is always writing me to make good
use of my opportunities. Poor mother,
I am all the boy she has got, and I know
how anxious she is about me. I don&#8217;t
mean to be wild, but I&#8217;m afraid that I am.&#8221;</p>

<p>The last words, mournfully spoken,
touched my heart. Besides, the idea of
his trifling with a mother&#8217;s love moved
me to speak.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">[191]</span>&#8220;Why not try now to do what you
feel to be right? You might easily be
the first in your class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I meant to be when I came here;
but when I saw how some of the others
managed, by degrees I fell into the same
ways.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not too late to commence. Mr.
Harlan told us that when we become conscious
of an error, we should turn from
it immediately. It is easy for us to do
wrong; and to turn as soon as we become
conscious of it, is the only true wisdom.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t believe I can here; the boys
all know me, and they will expect me to
do just as I have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>A little tap at the door. Charles
Eaton entered, and conversation took a
more general tone.</p>

<p>A few evenings after this, in passing
out of the supper-room, Mrs. Harlan<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">[192]</span>
handed me several papers, magazines,
etc. Looking them over, I found a notice
of the death of Charles Brisbane, my
first teacher. My eyes grew dim as I
gazed upon the record, which spoke of
early promise, rare graces of mind, and
the deep religious element underlying a
character devoted to the elevation of the
human race. I cannot describe the effect
produced by the perusal of that short
obituary. Mr. Brisbane&#8217;s words had
roused me to action, and taught me my
duty to myself and to my Maker; but
his death gave to his well-remembered
utterances all the force and power of a
voice from heaven. Thenceforth I cherished
his image still more, as one of my
choicest treasures; and the desire of my
heart was deepened to acquire knowledge
and discipline, and to be, like him, a good
and useful man.</p>

<p>And still, with all my resolves, I was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">[193]</span>
conscious I failed in the most important,
point. Did I love the Saviour as he did?
Did I as closely follow Him?</p>

<p>Winter passed, and spring blossomed
into beauty. Robert Lovell was again
with us. There was more study; examination
was coming, and all were anxious
to make a good appearance. My
room-mate was more studious, and Harry
Gilmore was trying to redeem time.
Out of school my time was taken up with
gardening; and much pleasanter it was
than making paths in the ice and snow.
True, I had never done any thing of this
before; but although a little awkward
at first, it soon came easy. Besides, it
brought me in continual contact with Mr.
and Mrs. Harlan; and their remarks
were not only pleasant, but profitable.
In the room of feeling despondent, as I
had now and then done during the winter,
I was cheerful and happy; and without<span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">[194]</span>
enjoying my books the less, I did enjoy
my labors more.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is strange how quickly the weeds
grow,&#8221; I said to Mrs. Harlan as I was
thinning out the early vegetables.</p>

<p>&#8220;I never look at the weeds without
thinking of my own heart,&#8221; she answered.
&#8220;Goodness, patience, humility, and faith
are here to be cultivated with constant
care; while selfishness and passion spring
up almost imperceptibly, and their seeds
are, like the thistle-down, borne on the
lightest breeze.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one comfort with the weeds,&#8221;
I answered; &#8220;we can cut them up by the
roots; but the evil in our hearts, the foolish
and wicked desires that so often strive
for the mastery, are not so easily managed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not by ourselves, Marston; but there
is One that can help us in this. Like the
careful gardener, that lops off and prunes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">[195]</span>
the vine till it seems, as it did to you
the other day, that it would die cut
down so closely, so God deals with us
according to the condition in which we
are placed, lopping off a branch here and
there, taking away a support, replanting
according to our needs and necessities,
and all to improve the growth and life,
that the fruit may be more abundant.
You remember in January, when the
shade-trees were trimmed, you thought
they were ruined, and exclaimed against
it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I thought they were cut too
closely, the last year&#8217;s growth almost
entirely cut away, leaving little but the
bare trunk.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you see now how they are putting
forth new and vigorous branches.
They had branches and leaves last year,
but no beauty; and there was too much
top for the roots; hence the necessity of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">[196]</span>
cutting them closely: watch them, and
you will see how much more beautiful
and fruitful they will be for such severe
pruning.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If we could always keep this in
mind,&#8221; I answered; &#8220;but it is so easy
to grow despondent when we cannot understand
the why and wherefore of our
trials.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;The plants do not ask why and
wherefore, but put forth all their energy
in the direction to which they are guided,&#8221;
was the reply.</p>

<p>&#8220;It is their nature; but with us it is
not so easy and natural,&#8221; I said.</p>

<p>&#8220;How so? it is our privilege to be
guided and supported. The Saviour is
often represented under the figure of a
gardener, his garden the world, and
the plants in it the human beings for
whom he died. If we are his servants,
the afflictions and privations we are called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">[197]</span>
upon to endure are only prunings
from his hand. Neither should we ask
why; but turning our gaze in the direction
specified, seek to fulfil his purpose.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And if we try, does he see and notice
our effort?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Marston, the fall of a sparrow
is noted by him; and there is nothing
connected with our well-being but interests
him. He is moved with a feeling of
compassion when he looks upon our suffering;
and so great is his love, that if he
could spare us the least pang he would
do so.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time I had finished the asparagus-bed,
while the rows of lettuce stood
neatly defined, and the delicate tendrils
of the pea-vines began twisting themselves
about for the support I had placed
within their reach. Mr. Harlan suggested
that one walk needed to be widened,
and another to be gravelled. It<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">[198]</span>
was Saturday, and I took the wheelbarrow
and crossed the pasture to the
brook.</p>

<p>While shovelling gravel, with my coat
off and sleeves rolled up, I heard shouts
and voices. A light wagon, drawn by
two spirited horses, and filled by half a
dozen boys, was coming down the road
from Terryville. Richard Farden was
driving, and when opposite me, he stopped.</p>

<p>&#8220;We are going down to see Frank
Clavers, and then on a fishing excursion
up the river. There is room enough for
one more; put down your sleeves and
jump in; we&#8217;ve plenty of hooks and
lines.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A grand treat it will be,&#8221; cried several
from the back seat; &#8220;you had better
come.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We shall have a splendid supper,&#8221;
added Richard, &#8220;and then home by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">[199]</span>
moonlight. Such a chance you don&#8217;t
get every day. Come on.&#8221;</p>

<p>I longed to avail myself of the privilege.
I had not had a ride, save on
horseback, for a long time. And then
it was to see Frank; and perhaps I could
stop for a moment at Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s,
and see Jennie. Still I had no time.
Mrs. Harlan was expecting me back,
and there stood the wheelbarrow half-full
of gravel. &#8220;No,&#8221; I answered, &#8220;I
cannot go. I have not the time; drive
on;&#8221; and I took my shovel, not daring
to look up till the handsome turnout was
out of sight.</p>

<p>The next half hour was one of mingled
feelings. Why was my lot so hard, and
that of others so easy? &#8220;He deals with
us according to our needs,&#8221; Mrs. Harlan
had said; and I tried hard to work cheerfully,
though saying to myself now and
then, &#8220;It is Saturday, and no more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">[200]</span>
fair had I gone home. How much good
it would have done me;&#8221; and plunging
my shovel into the yielding bank, I started
my wheelbarrow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not work so hard, Marston; you
look heated;&#8221; and Mrs. Harlan looked
up approvingly.</p>

<p>&#8220;What a difference it makes,&#8221; said
she as I scattered the gravel in heaps,
and then spread it evenly.</p>

<p>&#8220;It will require two or three loads
more,&#8221; I answered; and on I went, feeling
that any thing was better than to
stand still.</p>

<p>Again had I reached the gravelled
shore, and was shovelling away smartly,
when Harry Gilmore leaped down the
bank with his merry laugh and cheerful
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I was to envy anybody at Rockdale,
it would be you,&#8221; he said, after a
few words about the fishing party.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">[201]</span>&#8220;Me!&#8221; and I pointed to my bare arms
and my face dripping with perspiration.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, I believe you have more real
comfort than any one of us who have
rich fathers. You prize every hour in
school, because it costs you self-denial;
while we have never learned to value
privileges that cost us nothing. Now let
me help you,&#8221; he said, taking off his coat,
&#8220;for I am to have a drive in the evening,
and I want you should get through
in time to join me.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;A drive! where?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Anywhere you please; to Claverton,
if you will.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, that will be so good. Are you
really to go?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Certainly I am to go, and you are to
go with me. Now give me that shovel.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nothing more to do with it
just now.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What a pity there are not two wheelbarrows.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">[202]</span>
I will go back with you and
get another.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You forget your clothes,&#8221; I said,
looking at his neat suit of broadcloth.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gravel is clean; it will all brush off;&#8221;
and we started, each grasping a handle
of the wheelbarrow and keeping step over
the green sward.</p>

<p>With an amused look, Mrs. Harlan
eyed us as we came up.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two boys work faster than one,&#8221;
she said, as Harry scattered the gravel
and I smoothed it.</p>

<p>&#8220;Two more loads will be enough,
wont they, Mrs. Harlan?&#8221; asked Harry;
and being answered in the affirmative,
away he went to the wood-shed, and returned
with a heavier wheelbarrow for
himself.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not that, Harry; you are not accustomed
to it. If you insist on going, you
must take this.&#8221; With a few playful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">[203]</span>
words we exchanged wheelbarrows, while
Mrs. Harlan looked after us as we trundled
down the path at a brisk pace.</p>

<p>&#8220;How stupid. I forgot that we had
but one shovel,&#8221; said Harry with a light
laugh.</p>

<p>&#8220;I will fill both,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;No, I came to help you. I will sit
still while you fill yours; then you shall
rest till mine is ready, and we can start
even.&#8221;</p>

<p>There seemed to be no other way, and
I assented.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, old fellow,&#8221; said he as the
gravel lay piled in my barrow, &#8220;now
it&#8217;s my turn.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, Harry, it will tire you out; let
me,&#8221; I persisted.</p>

<p>&#8220;My back is no better than yours;
go and sit down.&#8221;</p>

<p>Overcome by his kindness, I went and
sat on the bank, hardly conscious of my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">[204]</span>
own identity. I had felt so bitterly in
the morning, thinking my lot so hard;
and now to find that Harry had stayed
at home to take me out for the evening,
and then, fearing I should not finish in
time, helping me himself&mdash;the boy that
never had waited on himself doing this
heavy work, and all for me.</p>

<p>&#8220;There, I am done,&#8221; leaving the shovel
standing upright in the middle of his load.</p>

<p>&#8220;You will find it heavy; you had better
tip out some,&#8221; I suggested.</p>

<p>&#8220;My arms are strong; have no fear,&#8221;
he answered, and struck into the path
ahead of me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Pretty warm,&#8221; said Harry, after a
few moments. &#8220;I reckon I&#8217;ll tip off my
vest instead of the gravel;&#8221; and I saw
that his collar was limp and the linen on
his shoulders wet through and through.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will be sufficient,&#8221; said Mrs.
Harlan as we finished smoothing the walk.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">[205]</span>
&#8220;You have worked so well, Marston,
the rest of the day may be your own.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Mrs. Harlan,&#8221; and Harry stood with
his cap in his hand, &#8220;I am to go to Claverton
this evening, for the ride merely,
and I would like to take Marston with
me, if you have no objection.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;To Claverton this evening! You
will see Miss Grimshaw and Jennie,&#8221;
turning to me.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I go, I shall hope to see them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I will see;&#8221; and she crossed the veranda
into her husband&#8217;s study.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, Mr. Harlan is willing you should
go,&#8221; she said. &#8220;I hope the ride will be
pleasant. Let me see you before you
go, Marston.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;All ready,&#8221; shouted Harry as he
drove up in a pretty open buggy drawn
by a high-spirited black horse, that pawed
the ground just a little, to show his impatience.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">[206]</span>&#8220;In a minute, Harry.&#8221; I had not yet
seen Mrs. Harlan, and I flew down stairs
and across the hall to the parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not there, Marston,&#8221; and Mrs. Harlan
called me to her own room. &#8220;Here
are a few things that I intended for you
before examination. It will be a good
time to wear them this evening, however,
and you may try them on at once;
I am impatient to see if they fit.&#8221;</p>

<p>My hand trembled as I took them, and
my voice still more.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not be afraid to wear them, you
have fairly earned them. Mr. Harlan
told me that he owed them to you.&#8221;</p>

<p>They were a nice spring suit of light
grey cloth. I could not stop to half
thank her, but hastened into my own
room, and slipping into them, gave one
look into the little mirror, and then down
stairs, under Mrs. Harlan&#8217;s kindly review,
and then out to Harry.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">[207]</span>&#8220;Why, Marston, what&#8217;s the matter?
You are actually crying.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It was all so unexpected,&#8221; I murmured,
dropping into my seat.</p>

<p>&#8220;They are not a bit too good for you;
I was with her when she ordered them.
The tailor measured me instead of you;
that&#8217;s the reason they fit so nicely. I
told Mrs. Harlan you could wear my
clothes. But come, cheer up; don&#8217;t let
a nice suit of clothes spoil your eyes.
We shall have lots to see.&#8221;</p>

<p>Impatient as I was to see Jennie, the
ride seemed short; and when we drove
up to Miss Grimshaw&#8217;s little white gate,
I thought I had never seen a picture half
so beautiful. It was a soft spring day,
the parlor windows open, and the white
muslin curtains fluttering in the breeze.
The breath of the lilacs perfumed the
air, and the tulips were budding into
beauty. Miss Grimshaw had moved her<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">[208]</span>
shop to a larger building, and we walked
up the yard and were looking through
the half-open door, when grandma spied
us, and came forward, leaning on her
staff.</p>

<p>&#8220;Why, Marston, is that you? I am
so glad to see you. How you have
grown, child.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And this is Harry Gilmore,&#8221; I answered,
till then forgetting to introduce
my companion.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sit down; Jennie will be in presently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Where is she, grandma?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;In the strawberry bed at the back
of the house. I will call her.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No, grandma, let us go for her: and
may we pick some strawberries?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;As many as you wish.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time Jennie had seen the
buggy, and surmising who had come,
started to meet us. One glad cry of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">[209]</span>
surprise, and her arms were round my
neck.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, brother, I am so glad to see you.
I began to fear you would never come
again;&#8221; then turning to Harry, as I named
him, she held out her little dimpled hand.
&#8220;I am glad you came to-day, the strawberries
are so fine. This is the first day
we have had them in abundance. Will
you take some of mine?&#8221; holding up a
bowl she had picked quite full, the red
stain still on her fingers.</p>

<p>&#8220;Grandma said we might help ourselves.&#8221;</p>

<p>An hour passed deliciously, and then
Jennie ran in, smoothed out her sunny
curls, and put on a fresh pretty gingham,
looking handsomer than I had ever seen
her before. Miss Grimshaw came in for
tea, and the nice white rolls were enjoyed
by us with a peculiar zest, while
the strawberries and cream were, as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">[210]</span>
Harry said, beyond all praise. After
tea we strolled out to the river, gathered
violets, and talked of our studies.</p>

<p>&#8220;It looks natural, and still every thing
wears a brighter hue,&#8221; I said to Jennie
as we stood on the door-step. &#8220;I have
never seen the spring half so beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is in ourselves,&#8221; Jennie
said. &#8220;You have not forgotten what
Mr. Kirby said: &#8216;If we think good and
happy thoughts, we shall look through
such a medium that every thing about
us will wear the same hue.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I like to hear you repeat what Mr.
Kirby said,&#8221; I continued. &#8220;Sometimes
I am afraid that I am forgetting him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;We both owe Mr. Kirby more than
anybody else in the world. We must
never forget him.&#8221;</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus219.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<p>Harry had been walking round the
flower beds with grandma. They stopped
near us, and she said, &#8220;You have grown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">[211]</span>
tall, Marston, and I hear people say that
you are getting to be a fine scholar. I
do not know much of books, but I have
picked up a verse that I want you to
think of: &#8216;The fear of the Lord is the
beginning of wisdom.&#8217;&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you too,&#8221; she continued, addressing
Harry. &#8220;You will both make
better men for heeding it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;So my mother says,&#8221; was Harry&#8217;s
reply.</p>

<p>We did not see Frank Clavers, neither
hear any thing of the excursionists.
At parting Jennie gave us a basket of
strawberries for Mrs. Harlan, and stood
with cheeks flushed and eyes misty with
tears, the gold brown curls waving over
her white shoulders.</p>

<p>&#8220;The prettiest picture that I have
ever seen,&#8221; said Harry as we drove
away. &#8220;You may well be proud of
your sister, Marston.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">[212]</span>&#8220;And so I am,&#8221; I replied. &#8220;The best
of all, she is as good as she is beautiful.&#8221;</p>

<p>For some reason we talked quite soberly
during our ride back to Rockdale,
going over the incidents of the past, and
the changes that our short lives had witnessed.
Then we talked of the future,
which we robed in bright hues like the
blossoms of that lovely spring time.
True, Harry was the principal talker.
My heart was full. Still I knew that I
must scale steep heights, tread rugged
paths, press on when footsore and weary,
perchance to meet little earthly success.
Ah, how mysterious a thing human life
would be, could we not discern in it the
threshold of a higher, purer existence.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak">XI.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">By</span> rigid economy, by laboring in vacation,
and performing various little offices
in term time, I managed to continue
at Rockdale two years. Latin was no
longer a trouble to me, and Greek was
becoming easy; but my purse was nearly
empty. I was in need of several new
books. And I began to turn in my mind
what I could do towards defraying new
expenses.</p>

<p>At this juncture the president of the
board of trustees visited the school,
where he remained the entire day, examining
the classes, and inspecting the
monthly reports. I had no suspicion of
his purpose, and consequently gave my
whole attention to my recitations. Although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">[214]</span>
not as quick as many, I had been
thorough, understood the principles of
almost every thing that I had been over,
and thus obtained correct answers. Greek
and Latin were read easily, and the
president was evidently satisfied with our
progress.</p>

<p>That evening Mr. Harlan sent for me
to his study. The time and the occasion
were new to me, and I went with some
trepidation. Mr. Harlan was not there,
but in his place the visitor, Mr. Stovill.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Harlan tells me that you intend
to go through college, if your hands and
your brains can take you there,&#8221; was his
somewhat abrupt greeting.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am hoping to go. Others have
done the same without more means.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;What will you do to obtain the
money? it will require a good deal for
that.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall work for it.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">[215]</span>&#8220;Would you haul wood, build a stone
Wall, or break stones on the street?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Any thing, sir, that offered me an
equivalent.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Then you do not think that work
will degrade you?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;On the contrary, I think that labor
will ennoble me. But as I wish to study,
I should like to do that which would bring
me the most for the least number of
hours.&#8221;</p>

<p>He was silent, while I sat in suspense
as to his purpose. What did he mean
by all these questions?</p>

<p>&#8220;I believe you will do,&#8221; he said at
length. &#8220;Young men are apt to think
that work will degrade them. They forget
that oaks spring from acorns, and
little efforts lead to great results. The
boy that will work to improve himself,
will pretty surely merge into the man
that will work for the good of others.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">[216]</span>In a few words he made known his
plan. Robert Lovell was going to college;
some one else must supply his
place as under-tutor.</p>

<p>Mr. Harlan had suggested the names
of two, Silas June and myself. Silas was
very quick, and priding himself on this,
he did not study. To be brilliant was
his desire, and yet he might have been
a thorough scholar had he studied. His
quickness ruined him.</p>

<p>This situation, in consideration of my
standing in class, was offered me, with
sufficient remuneration to defray all my
expenses.</p>

<p>I could hardly keep back the tears.
This ray of light stealing through the
darkness, was a reproof for all my faint-heartedness
and despondency. &#8220;No
right effort is ever lost.&#8221; There was a
sun behind the clouds, though I had
doubted it.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">[217]</span>&#8220;I might have had that chance,&#8221; said
June. &#8220;It was all my own foolishness.
If I had only known the day Mr. Stovill
was coming, I would have had my lessons;
there would have been no trouble.
My reports were against me.&#8221;</p>

<p>I could say nothing to comfort him,
and the hour passed without words.</p>

<p>&#8220;If I could only begin again, I would
not lean so much on my quickness. It
is the same old story&mdash;the hare and the
tortoise. You will get there quicker than
I shall.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is not too late for you,&#8221; said I;
&#8220;try it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I cannot do three years&#8217; work in one.
Besides, it is easier to fall into bad habits
than to get rid of them. After all, I may
get along just as well; but mother expected
me to fill Lovell&#8217;s place. She
wrote me in her last letter, that if I could
not help myself a little, she should have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">[218]</span>
to take my sister from school; she could
not afford the expense of both. Poor
mother.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Poor mother,&#8221; I echoed, and thought
of what I should do, had I only a mother
to write me letters full of loving
words, and a sister that must be taken
from school unless I could help myself
in a measure. I was roused by his
voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;We can never be young but once. I
want my share of pleasure.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Do you find it?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not yet; but I am hoping every day
for something better.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Which you will never find, I am
afraid. Judging from your own words,
you are making your mother unhappy,
and yourself miserable.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is so; but what can I do?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Break off your idle habits; say good-by
to your fun-loving companions, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">[219]</span>
begin to work right earnestly. This is
the way others have done.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I ought to do it; but it is too late.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And you will oblige your mother to
take that little sister from school?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, I hope not; she is not so poor
as she thinks. True, I have been spending
a good deal this winter. Gilmore
has a rich father, and I could not bear
to be shabby in the suppers.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was my last year at Rockdale;
and if the service was pleasanter, it was
not less arduous. I had very little time
for myself, a half hour&#8217;s stroll at twilight
being my only recreation. Still I believed
that I was improving, both intellectually
and morally; and this sufficed me. Jennie
was also climbing the hill of science
rapidly. Frank Clavers&#8217; sister had returned
the year previous from boarding-school;
and being pleased with Jennie,
and learning that she could sing, she had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">[220]</span>
offered to give her lessons in music. Seeing
her fondness for books, Miss Clavers
soon kindly offered to help her here also.
This called for additional gratitude on my
part; I had felt so troubled about this
little sister, whom my mother left in my
charge. Doing for myself, I hardly felt
it to be right not to aid her personally
more than my duties would allow. Now
she had the benefit of example, and also
the instruction of a young lady who was
said to be a finished scholar.</p>

<p>Thus easily I slipped into Robert
Lovell&#8217;s place as tutor, and also into his
class in Sabbath-school. Teaching others
is one of the best means of self-culture;
and I was in this way sent to my Bible,
if not more frequently, at least with a
more intense desire to understand its
teachings. Thinking, studying, meditating,
I drew nearer the cross each day;
each day began to realize more perfectly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">[221]</span>
the beauty of His words who spake as
never man spake, the glory of his countenance
beaming with untold love; the
terrible agony he suffered on the cross;
his willingness to forgive sin; and above
all, the encouragement in coming to
him freely, as to a friend loved and confided
in. Oh, why had I not seen this
before? I had hopes that I did love
him&mdash;that I did trust him&mdash;that I did follow
him; but Oh, it was so far off. Had
I been near, I should never have doubted
as I had done; I should never have
gone through all these months with my
heart heavy, the waters going over my
soul, striving to do only because I knew
it to be right, and only half trusting the
divine promise, &#8220;I will never leave thee,
nor forsake thee.&#8221; Oh, blind and foolish
heart, thus to grope in darkness when
He was waiting with outstretched arms
to receive thee.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">[222]</span>How bright and beautiful my pathway
now opened before me. Not that barriers
were all removed, obstacles all cleared
away; but I no longer felt troubled
with a weak, half trust. I knew His
promises were sure; that he would not
leave me; that he would be in reality
not a personal friend merely, but one
closer than a brother. A long time had
I been learning the lesson of his love, a
long time discovering the depth of his
tenderness; now, satisfied to rest on him,
I found it joy unutterable.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">My</span> first vacation after leaving Rockdale
was spent with Mr. Wyman. Four
years since I had left him, poor and ignorant.
Now, I certainly was not any
richer. Still I had advanced in knowledge
of books and in mental discipline;
and although my longing after an education
was not in the least abated, I had
learned there is nothing really desirable
in comparison with the fear of God and
true holiness. I did not care now to
choose in what part of his vineyard I
should work. I only wished to labor for
him; and to do this effectually, I must
not falter in my purpose of an education.</p>

<p>With this intent I went into the hay-field
with as much ardor as before into<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">[224]</span>
the school-room. Money, Mr. Stovill
said, was desirable to go through college
with, and I knew the worth of it.</p>

<p>&#8220;I see that you have not forgotten
how to work,&#8221; said Mr. Wyman, coming
into the meadow one sunny afternoon.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not forgetting, but still more accustomed
to it, Mr. Wyman. I have been
hard at it ever since I was here.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is a difference between head
work and hand work,&#8221; said the farmer
with a quiet smile.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have been doing both,&#8221; I replied;
&#8220;turning book leaves has not bleached
my hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;While I have to confess to the doing
of only one. The young folks of this day
have much better advantages than were
common when I was a boy. We had no
such schools then as Rockdale.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I think you do yourself injustice,
Mr. Wyman, when you say that you<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">[225]</span>
have only been working with your hands.
Had it not been for you, I could not
have gone to Rockdale when I did, if
ever. In word and deed, your labor has
budded, blossomed, and brought forth
fruit. We sometimes study quite as
effectually out of books as in them.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; but if I could live my life over
again, I should think more of a book education.
Those that know the most have
the means of doing the most good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is one comforting truth,&#8221; said
I, turning the hay vigorously: &#8220;God
directs all our steps. He appoints our
place; he gives us our work. I used to
think there was in labor a great choice,
and although I was willing to do any
thing because I felt it to be right, still
there was also a consciousness that, could
I choose, such would not be my employment.
I remember the morning I came
here for the first time; I rebelled not a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">[226]</span>
little against it. Still it was a means, a
stepping-stone to the desired good.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And is it not the same now?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;No; I am willing to be directed. I
like to be led by Him, and feel safe in
following. Then I feared continually lest
I should make a mistake, and through
weakness or ignorance fail to use the
means to the greatest advantage. Now
I try to exercise human wisdom and a
prudent forethought, and still rest contented,
whatever the result. The Lord
knows all, and he knows whether this or
that shall prosper. To do right, and to
do my best, is all that he requires of me;
events are with him, and success is given
wheresoever he pleases.&#8221;</p>

<p>Saturday evening at length came. We
had worked hard through the week, but
the hay was not all in. Nine o&#8217;clock,
and there still remained several loads.
A consultation was called.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">[227]</span>&#8220;It looks like rain,&#8221; said Mr. Wyman.
&#8220;But you are all tired, and the
oxen have done enough for one day;
perhaps we had better let it rest. It
will not rain to-night; and if it does to-morrow,
it wont take long to put in three
loads.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But to-morrow will be Sunday, Mr.
Wyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I know; but it would not be right to
let the hay spoil.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I do not understand that; the command
is positive: &#8216;Six days shalt thou
labor, and do all thy work: but the seventh
day is the Sabbath of the Lord thy
God: in it thou shalt not do any work,
thou, nor thy son, nor thy daughter, thy
man-servant, nor thy maid-servant, nor
thy cattle, nor thy stranger that is within
thy gates.&#8217; Nothing can be more explicit.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is also equally incumbent upon us<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">[228]</span>
not to waste our substance,&#8221; said Mr
Wyman. &#8220;If you read the New Testament
rightly, you will find that it is lawful
to do works of mercy and necessity.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;True; but would the getting in hay
be counted such a work, when God expressly
bids us keep his Sabbath even in
harvest time?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, if the hay was to be spoiled by
the neglect, it ought to be got in.&#8221;</p>

<p>There was no more said. It was late,
and the men dispersed. I went directly
to my room, not a little disconcerted
about what I might be called upon to do.
Mr. Wyman was an old man, and had
been very kind to me; it was not for me
to speak to him as an equal. He felt it
to be right; I felt it to be a direct act of
disobedience. We must each act according
to our conscience; and with this
thought I went to sleep.</p>

<p>The next morning the sun peeped<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">[229]</span>
through a dull, hazy atmosphere, looked,
and was gone, showing occasional glimpses
of his face till nearly church time, when
the clouds began to gather and roll themselves
into inky blackness, and rain
seemed inevitable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Put the oxen to the cart,&#8221; said Mr.
Wyman; &#8220;that hay will be ruined.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But, pa, it is Sunday,&#8221; said Mrs.
Wyman.</p>

<p>&#8220;Well, what if it is? You are ready
to go to church, and the wagon is at the
door; go on, I shall stop for the hay. It
is just as much a duty to save our property
as to do any thing else. We are
told to be diligent in business;&#8221; and the
farmer exchanged his Sunday coat for
his work-day one, and went out.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marston,&#8221; he said as he passed
through the back porch, &#8220;you load faster
than any of the others. If we hurry,
we can get it in and then go to church.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">[230]</span>&#8220;I cannot do that kind of work on the
Sabbath, Mr. Wyman. I regard it as an
open violation of His law.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you cannot work for me to-day,
you certainly cannot to-morrow.&#8221;</p>

<p>I did not stop to question; there was
but one course for me. My head bowed
over my hands. To lose Mr. Wyman&#8217;s
friendship was more than I could bear.</p>

<p>&#8220;What is that to thee? follow thou
me,&#8221; floated through my brain and comforted
me. Presently a light hand was
on my shoulder, and a kind voice said,</p>

<p>&#8220;Marston, will you drive us to church?
I do not think it will rain at all.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;If you desire it, Mrs. Wyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>We started, Mrs. Wyman with Emma
and Alice. As we passed the meadow,
Mr. Wyman was busily pitching on the
hay, Anderson and Gregory each having
a cart. The oxen stood with their great
patient eyes rolling about, as if not quite<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">[231]</span>
sure of the right of breaking in upon
their day of rest. Nothing was said,
however.</p>

<p>We reached the church door just in
time to escape a few quiet drops; but
these were soon gone; the clouds unrolled
and dispersed their dark folds, and
before noon all was bright again.</p>

<p>&#8220;Oh, father, you should have heard
the sermon this morning,&#8221; said Alice
Wyman, a sweet, blooming girl, tripping
into the parlor as though nothing had
happened. The farmer sat in his straight-backed
chair, the hay was all in, and he
was reading the Bible.</p>

<p>&#8220;What was the text, child?&#8221; he at
length said.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8216;Trust in the Lord, and do good;
so shalt thou dwell in the land, and verily
thou shalt be fed.&#8217; Mr. Gordon spoke
so beautifully of the implicit trust we are
privileged to have, it seemed to me I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">[232]</span>
never felt so forcibly before how far short
we come of realizing all that might be
ours, the contentment that would fill our
hearts, would we put aside self and lean
more perfectly upon Him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;But there is something for us to do,&#8221;
said her father. &#8220;We are not to sit
still; we are to act, and that diligently.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; answered Mrs. Wyman, &#8220;Mr.
Gordon said there was something for us
to do. The first act was obedience; the
second was love and trust.&#8221;</p>

<p>By this time dinner was on the table.
The farmer was evidently in no talkative
mood, and few words were spoken.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I walked with Alice
to the Sabbath-school, and returned comforted.
Perhaps Mr. Wyman would turn
me off; it was more than probable he
would. I had displeased him. Still,
having done what I thought to be right,
I would trust it all to God.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">[233]</span>The next morning as we finished breakfast,
and before we arose from the table,
Mr. Wyman said,</p>

<p>&#8220;I owe you for two weeks&#8217; work, Marston:
I am sorry for what happened yesterday;
still I must have the direction of
what shall be done on my own farm. I
shall fill your place with some one who
will do what I ask of him.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Had it been any other than a plain,
positive command, I should have gone
with you, Mr. Wyman; but so positive
is the decree with regard to the Sabbath,
there could be no question with me concerning
my duty.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mrs. Wyman and Alice followed me
down the walk, and begged me not to
cherish unkind feelings towards Mr.
Wyman.</p>

<p>&#8220;No fear of that,&#8221; I answered. &#8220;He
has always been my friend, and I shall
not think unkindly of him for this. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">[234]</span>
is too good a man not to be sorry when
he thinks of it with his accustomed coolness.&#8221;</p>

<p>I had nothing to do but to walk back
to Claverton, and tell Jennie what had
befallen me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am sorry, Marston; but I should
have been still sorrier had you acted
otherwise;&#8221; and she pressed her red lips
to mine. &#8220;An entire obedience is necessary.
Do not be troubled; some good
will come of it.&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked down to the little gate,
where stood a messenger from Mr. Willett.</p>

<p>&#8220;Mr. Willett would like to see Marston,&#8221;
as Jennie took the message.</p>

<p>&#8220;He has not been well for several
weeks, and has inquired for you continually,&#8221;
she said, as she held the gate for
me to pass.</p>

<p>Mr. Willett was pillowed up in his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">[235]</span>
easy-chair, and seemed delighted to see
me.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that you are free,&#8221; he said
at length. &#8220;I have been sick, and the
doctor forbids all kinds of exertion. Every
thing is going to ruin in the store.
If you will just go in, I shall consider it
a great favor, and will give you more
than you can get doing any thing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>How soon the black cloud had showed
a silver lining. I had felt so unwilling to
leave Mr. Wyman, so sad and desponding,
that I could not think of any thing
else as I walked back to the village.
With all my waywardness, God was not
unmindful. Could I ever despond again?
I felt at the time that it would be impossible.</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you something good would
come of it,&#8221; said Jennie as I crossed the
street and once more entered the parlor.
&#8220;&#8216;A right effort is never lost.&#8217; This<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">[236]</span>
should teach us both to trust more perfectly.&#8221;</p>

<p>Mr. Willett recovered rapidly; and
by the time vacation was over, I was
appointed a regular teacher in the Rockdale
academy.</p>

<p>&#8220;This will delay your college course,
but it will be better for you in the end,&#8221;
said Mr. Harlan. &#8220;You are still young
enough to wait next year, and your salary
will enable you to begin. Besides,
if you choose to study while teaching, I
will aid you all I can; and I have little
doubt you can enter the Sophomore class
instead of the Freshman.&#8221;</p>

<p>This was a step I had not thought of,
and I quickly resolved not a moment
should be lost; to teach and to study
should be my work for another year.</p>

<p>Among the first of the new pupils that
particularly interested me when I entered
upon my duties was Ezra Metcalf.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">[237]</span>
Stimulated by his little teacher, he had
put forth very commendable effort; and
through the interest of Mr. Gordon and
one or two benevolent ladies of Terryville,
Mr. Harlan had been induced to
take him, the boy paying his board, as I
had done, by labor.</p>

<div class="figcenter"><img src="images/illus247.jpg" alt="" /></div>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">[238]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XIII.</h2>
</div>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> proved as Mr. Harlan had said.
The next year I entered the Sophomore
class, once more finding myself face to
face with Frank Clavers and Harry Gilmore.
Their greeting was most cordial,
and Harry&#8217;s friendship was as warm as
ever. Although my year&#8217;s salary had
clothed me decently and left me something
for books, it still required the closest
economy to get along; making me appear,
to those who had plenty, as close and parsimonious.
This was in itself a trial, and
the hardest with which I had to contend.
Yet my frank avowal of a scanty purse
saved me from many temptations. In
the various expedients of the students
for killing time I was not expected to
share; and still I always had a spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">[239]</span>
dollar for a new book, or sufficient to
expend upon a course of scientific lectures;
while there were some lavish in
expenditures for rides, suppers, ices, and
sherbet, who were at times obliged to
deny themselves the means of improvement.</p>

<p>It was not trying to acknowledge poverty
when the admission brought no dishonor.
Still, when with some of my
class-mates who were rich men&#8217;s sons,
and well supplied with pin-money, I
found to my cost that I had not learned
the lesson of self-conquest so perfectly as
I had flattered myself. I was once looking
at a second-hand book in the presence
of Morris and Wright, two of the
richest students in college.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is what I call small business,
to look up old threadbare books,&#8221; said
Morris, in a tone that I could not avoid
hearing, at the same time ordering a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">[240]</span>
new copy of the same work; to which
Wright replied, while a contemptuous
smile wreathed his proud lips. I could
have wept with vexation; and the next
moment was ashamed of myself for giving
way to such a weak, ignoble feeling.</p>

<p>Through all these days Jennie&#8217;s letters
comforted me, and Mr. and Mrs. Harlan
did not forget me.</p>

<p>&#8220;Regard the right,&#8221; said the latter in
one of her letters, &#8220;and seek for companions
such as honor it. Think too
much of yourself to cherish a selfish
thought or feeling; and let every act
prove that a light purse does not of necessity
imply low tastes or a meagre intellect.&#8221;</p>

<p>Little did the good woman imagine all
the trials springing out of my weakness.
Still the strife was short, and invariably
I found my way back to the sheltering
arms of that Friend who looks not alone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">[241]</span>
to the outward, and who judges not as
man judges.</p>

<p>Overhearing one of the professors saying
that he could not find a suitable gardener
for his grounds, and having learned
a good deal of gardening from Mr. Harlan,
I offered myself, and was accepted.
I needed exercise. This was just as
good as boating, ball-playing, or the
gymnasium.</p>

<p>One Saturday, as I returned from the
river with a wheelbarrow of pebbles for
the flooring of a new arbor I had just
planned, I met several of my class-mates
at the gate. Conquering my first impulse
of false shame, I advanced as though it
was the most pleasant exercise imaginable.</p>

<p>&#8220;Gardening for the pleasure of it?&#8221;
said Stevens, in a tone of irony he knew
so well to use.</p>

<p>&#8220;Not for pleasure, Stevens, but from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">[242]</span>
necessity;&#8221; and I walked on. The next
meeting was easier. I had filled the
wheelbarrow again, and was crossing the
carriage-way, when Wright drove leisurely
along in an open buggy. As he
passed me he touched his hat, while a
mocking smile wreathed his lips:</p>

<p>&#8220;There goes the best scholar in his
class.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;And the best I intend to be,&#8221; I said
to myself, but without any unpleasant
feeling.</p>

<p>Finishing my task, I went to the office
for letters; passing the hotel just as the
numerous hacks had left a greater number
of guests than usual. I had nearly
passed, when suddenly my name was called,
and in a voice that seemed strangely
familiar. It was Silas June. He had
given up study, and had been two years
in the city, and talked largely of city
pleasures and pursuits. His uncle had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">[243]</span>
recently become very wealthy through
land speculation, and had generously
offered Mrs. June a home, and also taken
Silas into his employ as a clerk.</p>

<p>&#8220;I suppose you are planning ways
and means yet,&#8221; he said at length. &#8220;I
remember you used to be good at this.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Practice makes perfect,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I have never had any thing else to do,
and I am now quite as expert as ever.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I told you I should get along just as
well without so much study, although I
did not then dream of the good in store
for me. Uncle is rich, and without a
family of his own. He must do something
with his money, and I shall come
in for a large share.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I hope you will repay him by making
a good and noble man.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I shall please him, if that is what
you mean, although it goes greatly against
my inclination to sit bound down day<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">[244]</span>
after day to the day-book and ledger.
Still night comes, and I enjoy while he
sleeps.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You enjoy; how so?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Go to parties, operas, theatres, or
into some saloon; anywhere, if I find
good company.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You used to try to deceive yourself
with regard to study,&#8221; I said, with a degree
of earnestness that made him laugh
heartily. &#8220;Do not deceive yourself now,
and run into company that will lead you
to ruin, just because your uncle is rich
enough to give you the opportunity.
Deception cannot prosper.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t everybody deceive&mdash;everybody
but you and Lovell?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;That many practise it, I allow, and
that some for a time succeed, is very
possible; but the end is not yet.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;There is no use in denying self-interest
is the motive,&#8221; he answered; &#8220;and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">[245]</span>
if some noble deeds and benevolent actions
are performed, the mainspring is
the same. I humor my uncle, for I need
his money; you study enough to kill a
common man, making this a stepping-stone
to something else. What&#8217;s the
difference?&#8221;</p>

<p>There was a difference, notwithstanding
his fluent speech. Back as far as I
could look there was still one purpose&mdash;
a strong and noble manhood, a life of
usefulness and honor; and in my estimation,
a good education would greatly contribute
to bring this about. This was
why I studied, why I was resolved to
study&mdash;not merely distinction, worldly
honor, or aggrandizement, but to possess
a truly excellent character, worthy
the regard of others and the respect of
myself.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">At</span> length a year in college had passed;
one more layer was unwrapped from
round the kernel of college lore, and as
Juniors we were trying with renewed
powers honorably to rival each other.</p>

<p>Not alone to us change had come, but
to others. Miss Clavers had opened a
seminary in the little village bearing her
father&#8217;s name, and Jennie was an assistant.
How full of love and encouragement
were her letters. How strange it
all seemed: no longer a little girl that
nestled in my arms, and looked up to
me as one able to do so much, but a tall,
stately young woman, going in and out
before her pupils with the conscious
grace of one who feels that she is able to
do all that she has undertaken.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">[247]</span>It was a bright autumn day when Stevens
invited a party of some half a dozen
students to walk with him to a town not
far distant. For the last six months I
had been on friendly terms with him, so
I did not think it strange when he invited
me; neither did I refuse to go. It
was a perfect day: the rich, fervid hues
of autumn were spread over miles of forest-trees
and shrubbery; a thin veil of
mist hung over every winding stream,
while the brilliant sunshine illuminated
the many varying shades of wood, water,
and cloud, blending all in perfect harmony.</p>

<p>That hazy, dreamy atmosphere, how
well I remember it. The memory of
that walk makes my heart beat with
much of its youthful buoyancy. Under
the exhilarating influence of the day, and
our unexpected freedom, we ran, laughed,
shouted&mdash;appearing, as we really were, a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">[248]</span>
company of grown-up school-boys. I remember
Harry Gilmore&#8217;s mirthful tone
as we pelted him with chestnuts, and
how Wright forgot his dignity when we
covered his hat and shoulders with red
and yellow leaves.</p>

<p>After visiting a gallery of paintings,
which was the ostensible object of the
excursion, and which we all expressed
ourselves as sorry to leave, Stevens
invited us to step into a restaurant for
refreshment. Wright and Gilmore left
us to make a call, but the remainder of
the party entered the saloon.</p>

<p>When seated in an elegant room, we
were soon supplied with tempting viands.
Not satisfied with a lavish profusion of
fruits, cakes, and ices, Stevens rang for
the waiter, to whom he gave orders in
an undertone, the nature of which was
evident from the speedy appearance of
glasses and bottles.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">[249]</span>&#8220;Now to the health of the company:
may the shadow of each never be less,&#8221;
said Stevens, filling his glass. There
was a burst of applause, and I looked
around the table, hoping to find at least
one representative of total abstinence;
but with the exception of my own, every
glass was drained.</p>

<p>&#8220;How is this?&#8221; said Stevens, eyeing
me keenly; &#8220;afraid or unwilling to pledge
me in a glass of wine?&#8221; All eyes were
turned upon me, and I felt the blood recede
from my face.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am afraid, Stevens. I saw a student
carried to his room the other night.
If I take a glass now, who knows but I
may one day be found in a like situation?&#8221;</p>

<p>We walked back more quietly than
we went. The sun had set, and a vaporous
veil of golden haze had floated off
into the purple twilight, and the watching<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">[250]</span>
stars came out one by one, with a
dim, subdued light, only seen on such
autumnal nights. Stevens, who was my
companion in spite of my not joining
him in the wine, was in a contemplative
mood.</p>

<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t approve,&#8221; he said, &#8220;of wine,
tobacco, or any thing of the kind, and
very often I make up my mind never to
touch them again; especially did I the
other night when I saw Darcy in such a
state.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;It is the only safe course,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;I know it,&#8221; he said earnestly, &#8220;and
I like you all the better for not touching
it. I only ordered it for fear there were
some who would think it mean; &#8216;nothing
to drink,&#8217; as they say.&#8221;</p>

<p>And so I believe it would be in every
instance where a young man openly
avows his determination not to drink,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">[251]</span>
smoke, or chew, waste his time, or trifle
with duty. After his resolves have once
been tested, he will only be thought more
of by the wildest associate he has, and
his influence from that moment will be
wider and more powerful.</p>

<p>In college, as elsewhere, it is easy to
select our associates. If we wish, we
can have the most studious and high-minded;
or the pleasure-seeker, who
came to college because it was fashionable
to do so, and will get a diploma, if
he gets one at all, because the wealth of
his father purchases it for him, the same
as any other article of luxury.</p>

<p>Still, try as I would, I could not make
friends with Wright. At first he had
looked down upon me: more recently he
seemed to regard me only as a rival;
and to say the truth, we were quite even,
our regular marks in recitation seldom
varying. The time now came when the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">[252]</span>
subject for a prize essay was given out,
and knowing my chief competitor would
be Wright, I determined to surpass him.</p>

<p>Not having a strong constitution, study
wore upon him sadly.</p>

<p>&#8220;Do not work so hard, I entreat you,&#8221;
said our President one day as he saw
how wan and pale Wright was growing.
&#8220;There is no use in this,&#8221; taking the
feverish hand in his. &#8220;Indeed I have
been blind not to see it before; you must
rest, at all hazards.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Not now,&#8221; said Wright. &#8220;I came
here to take the first honor in my class,
and I will do it.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You will not live to reach it, at this
rate; and then what profit can come
from all your ambitious labors?&#8221;</p>

<p>A week or two afterwards Wright
was prostrate.</p>

<p>&#8220;They say that you will win the
prize,&#8221; said Stevens, coming into my<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">[253]</span>
room on his way from the sick-bed.
&#8220;If poor Wright had not been sick, you
might not have been so certain, however.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Wright probably wrote his essay
before he was sick,&#8221; I answered.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes, he wrote it, and I have read
it, and I assure you it is a fine production;
but he cannot read it, and of course
the prize will be yours.&#8221;</p>

<p>I went to my room in no enviable
state of mind. I wanted the prize. I
had worked for it. But if Wright had
written his essay, he must not lose the
honor because he was sick. Nothing
more was said of it, and all seemed to
take it for granted that I should be the
successful competitor.</p>

<p>At last I could bear it no longer. I
called upon Stevens, as a friend of Wright,
to procure the essay; and then, with the
conviction that I was destroying my own<span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">[254]</span>
hopes, I carried it to the chairman of the
committee, and begged him to suspend
his decision until this had been sufficiently
examined.</p>

<p>The result was as I expected. Wright
was announced the winner of the prize
at the same time we were told that he
was dangerously ill. How insignificant
at that hour the honors of the world! How
sorry I was that, in order to rival me, he
had been obliged to study so hard; how
glad to think that perhaps he might know
that he had won, and the knowledge give
him pleasure.</p>

<p>Not long afterwards a messenger came
to me from the sick-room. Wright wanted
to see me. I found him lying upon
his bed, pale and wasted, the mere shadow
of his former self.</p>

<p>&#8220;I wanted to thank you for your sacrifice
on my behalf; they told me all
about it;&#8221; and his eyes closed languidly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">[255]</span>
I pressed his thin hand cordially in my
own.</p>

<p>&#8220;Nor is that all,&#8221; he said, opening his
eyes, glistening with deep feeling. &#8220;I
want you to forgive my former rudeness.
I have always been ashamed of it; not
a moment but I have longed to tell you
of my regard; but you were my rival in
study, and I could not bear it.&#8221;</p>

<p>Was this Wright, the rich student,
the one who had never given me a word
save those dictated by common civility,
now asking my pardon, and saying that
he had always regarded me, and had
longed to tell me so? There was no
room for deception; there he lay, weak
and pale. I could not restrain my emotion,
and before I was aware, I was on
my knees, my arms about him, and my
head resting on his pillow.</p>

<p>&#8220;Sickness has taught me to see life
under a new phase,&#8221; he resumed. &#8220;These<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">[256]</span>
petty rivalries are unworthy the attention
of immortal beings. I have lived
as though this life were all, following a
shadow until it had well-nigh landed me
in the grave. Oh what would have become
of me had I died then?&#8221; and a
shudder passed over his features. &#8220;You
will be glad to know that I have found
Him whom you have loved for a long
time. I trust my sins are pardoned, that
I have given my heart to the Saviour.
You must be my friend now; I cannot
rest till I have it from your own lips.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Now, and ever,&#8221; I answered, as well
as my emotion would allow. A sweet
peace showed itself on his countenance.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you would forgive me.&#8221;</p>

<p>The attendant came in and said that
he must rest, and I went out full of wonder
at the power that could humble a
proud spirit like Wright&#8217;s, and change
him to a meek penitent.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">[257]</span>My astonishment was increased when
returning health enabled him to go on
with his studies. There was no longer
rivalry; a new purpose burned in his
heart, beamed in his eye, and influenced
every look and word; not one that had
known him before but was constrained
to say that he had been with Jesus.</p>

<p>My last year in college was a constant
delight to me. I was not so much
pressed by pecuniary matters. Above
all, I had succeeded in winning the good-will
and esteem of those around me.
After Wright&#8217;s illness, his heart clung to
me with as much intensity as before he
had carefully avoided me, while Harry
Gilmore gave me all a brother&#8217;s love,
and Frank Clavers was the same true
friend as ever.</p>

<p>At Commencement, when the highest
honor was awarded me, I felt a thrill of
satisfaction that was an ample equivalent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">[258]</span>
for long years of labor. Afterwards,
when I stood before the assembled throng,
conscious that many eyes were upon me,
and bright, happy faces looking their approval,
I only saw one, a sweet, pure
face, with the golden hair parted over a
broad white forehead, while an expression
of peace and of trust rested on the
whole countenance. It was a happy day
to Jennie. So far my work was done,
and, they said, well done. I looked upon
it as only reaching another stage in my
ascent; the first and second heights were
won, and a profession was now to be
chosen.</p>

<p>In the evening there was a levee at
the President&#8217;s house, and for Jennie&#8217;s
sake as well as my own I was glad. The
good man received me very kindly, and
so far unbent himself as to speak of the
courage and industry of my last three
years, then of my success&mdash;introducing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">[259]</span>
me to several men who were there, and
whom it was an honor and a privilege to
meet. &#8220;Energy is essential,&#8221; he said,
&#8220;but patience and perseverance are the
crowning virtues. You have practised
these faithfully. God grant that you
may continue to do the same to the end.&#8221;</p>

<p>It was a happy gathering; and when
I went to my room, it was first to fall
upon my knees, pouring out my heart
in gratitude to that God who had been
so mindful, leading me by the hand up
through the narrow defile of poverty and
want, into a broader way, where I could
catch glimpses of the promised land, renewing
my vows, and consecrating myself
anew to his service.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">[260]</span>

<h2 class="nobreak">XV.</h2>
</div>


<p>&#8220;<span class="smcap">Now</span> you are ready for a profession,&#8221;
said Miss Grimshaw, as once more
we were seated in her little parlor.</p>

<p>&#8220;Marston is troubled about being a
lawyer,&#8221; Jennie said, as she leaned over
my shoulder, running her taper fingers
through my hair. &#8220;He used to think
he could be happy in nothing else.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Yes,&#8221; said grandma, &#8220;what fine
speeches he used to make before the
looking-glass, and how often he said he
would never undertake a case that was
not just, and then he would be sure to
win.&#8221;</p>

<p>True, grandma&#8217;s words carried me far
back into my boyhood. I could see
now that I had been ambitious. Poor
and friendless, I had read of others who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">[261]</span>
had attained worldly preferment and
riches, and I resolved to do the same.
To be a successful lawyer seemed to me
to be the height of intellectual attainment.
This I would be, and for this did
I first study. I was ambitious for myself,
and I was equally ambitious for Jennie.</p>

<p>Once my great desire was to rise in
the world; but now my aim was higher.
As a lawyer, I did not intend that my
knowledge and influence should become
a screen for guilt. I would never be an
oppressor of the poor and miserable. I
had not the remotest wish to make vice
appear virtue, nor to clothe transgressors
in the garb of honorable men; neither
did I expect to bury my conscience.
I looked for a noble manhood.</p>

<p>Now it seemed to me my life could
not be spent aright if I did not make the
service of God my chief and direct aim,
and that no other service would suit me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">[262]</span>
so well as, in utter self-renunciation, to
give myself entirely to the work of saving
poor ruined sinners, spending my
time, talents, health, all, in telling in the
nooks and corners of the land, wherever
I could find a listener, of the depth and
fulness of His love for man. Compared
with this, the fields of worldly ambition
seemed a vast waste, without flowers or
fruit.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad that you feel like this,
Marston;&#8221; and grandma tottered across
the room and laid her withered hand
upon my head. &#8220;I have prayed earnestly
for this. Young, earnest, persevering,
you have the power of doing
much good. I am thankful, Oh how
thankful, that you see it in this light.&#8221;</p>

<p>The tears streamed over the cheeks
of this aged saint. Jennie was weeping
too, and I could not speak. I felt my
own unworthiness and insufficiency, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">[263]</span>
only prayed that God would give me
that ready tact and skill to say and do
those things that would be pleasing in
his sight, and enable me to win souls for
his kingdom.</p>

<p>Still, I had only passed through my
collegiate course; there were years of
preparation before I could become fitted
for the high and noble office of a preacher
of his word. In the darkest lot there
is some sunshine. With health, strength,
some culture of mind, and the presence
of my Saviour, the passing clouds only
made the sunshine brighter.</p>

<p>Before the vacation closed I met Mr.
Wyman. With his old frankness, he
invited us all to spend the day with him,
and more than this, sent his carriage to
take us there. Considering that I had
done nothing wrong, I was delighted with
again meeting him, as well as Mrs. Wyman
and Alice, in their old home.</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">[264]</span>My greeting was cordial, while his had
all the tenderness of a father.</p>

<p>&#8220;I am glad to see, Marston, that you
can forgive me for sending you away as
I did. I knew that I was wrong, that I
ought not to do it, that I was breaking
a positive command; but I had always
seen it done. My father I believed to
be a good man; and though he did not
work on the Sabbath, still, if his harvest
or his hay-field was in danger of being
ruined by a shower, he gathered it in,
let the day be what it might. Then I
was angry that you should reprimand me
before all the hands.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I only repeated the commandment.
I did not intend it as a reproof of mine.
It was God&#8217;s command, and must be
obeyed.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew it; but I was vexed. You
have forgiven me, Marston, and I hope
God has forgiven me. I have not had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">[265]</span>
any Sabbath work done on the place
since then, that could possibly be avoided;
and I trust that I live nearer my
Saviour and am a more consistent Christian
than I was before.&#8221;</p>

<p>Neither of us said any more on that
subject; and before we left, we bowed
with clasped hands to seek our Father&#8217;s
blessing upon the reconciliation and on
our future life.</p>

<p>&#8220;Henceforth you shall truly stand to
me in the light of Willie,&#8221; said Mr. Wyman;
&#8220;and still, had Willie lived, he
would have been a minister in the room
of a lawyer.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;By the grace of God, I am to be a
minister, Mr. Wyman.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Are you, Marston? God be thanked
for this. How many times during the
last four years have I washed it. But
we thought you were fully determined
to become a lawyer.&#8221;</p>



<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">[266]</span>&#8220;So I was; but God has made me feel
that it is the highest honor for mortals
to serve him, and the highest service to
spend and be spent in telling poor sinful
men of the Saviour. If I can get
through with my theological studies, I
trust this will be my work.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;You can and you shall, Marston.
Willie was to have been a minister. You
shall be to me as my Willie would have
been.&#8221;</p>

<p>When we re&euml;ntered the farm-house
there was great rejoicing, Mrs. Wyman
taking me by the hand and telling me
how thankful she felt that I had changed
my purpose.</p>

<p>&#8220;A broad field of usefulness lies before
you, Marston; you must, you will fill it
nobly.&#8221;</p>

<p>I entered upon my theological course
at once. Mr. Wyman was faithful to
his promise, making of me a second Willie.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">[267]</span>
And now, as the pastor of a prosperous
church, I love to look back over
the track of my early years, and read
His goodness in ordering all my steps.
Surely his goodness is unsearchable, and
his love past finding out.</p>

<p>Led by His grace, I love to recount all
his goodness in the way he has led me.
I never pass a lad in the street, dirty,
ragged, and homeless, but I think of my
own early lot; never look upon the pale
face and blue eyes of a little girl, that I
do not think of Jennie, kept by his goodness
and shielded by his love. And I
would say to all the climbers&mdash;to all
those boys and girls who are striving to
help themselves, to work, and study&mdash;first
make the Saviour your friend, give
him your hearts, then go on courageously
in the path he will be sure to open before
you. Never stop to parley with
wrong, or to shun a duty, however small<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">[268]</span>
and insignificant. A lofty purpose, pursued
with undeviating integrity, never
fails of a rich and gracious reward.</p>

<p>Would you know of my class-mates?
Robert Lovell is a foreign missionary,
known and loved of God and man.
Frank Clavers and Harry Gilmore are
lawyers of acknowledged ability and
rare moral worth. Wright, my former
rival, is not only a brother clergyman
and friend, but as the husband of my
darling Jennie, he claims still more of
my regard.</p>

<p>Surely the prayers of our sainted mother,
and the supplications of our early
friend, were heard by Him who ruleth
all. Our path has been hedged about
by his kindness, and his banner over us
has been love.</p>

1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
